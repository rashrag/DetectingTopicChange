NARRATOR April 20th 1918 In the skies over northern France Allied and German fighter aircraft are locked in a ferocious dogfight One of the contenders in this aerial battle is the legendary German ace Manfred von Richthofen the Red Baron His distinctive red Fokker triplane is in hot pursuit over the Somme Valley in its sights are two British Sopwith Camel fighters First one and then the second are swiftly eliminated by the deadly marksman They are the 79th and 80th kills of the Red Barons career

Below the Germans are engaged in a final massive offensive to end the First World War German troops and supplies pour into the Somme Valley in northeastern France To counter them British and Australian soldiers set up defensive artillery and machinegun positions on high ground overlooking the River Somme Part of their job is to watch out for German reconnaissance planes Both armies need to know the position of each others forces This vital intelligence can only be gathered properly from the air

Protecting German reconnaissance flights Manfred von Richthofen Germanys greatest ace has brought his feared flying circus up to the front Opposing them are Royal Air Force squadrons flying the Sopwith Camel one of the nimblest fighters ever built Both sides are flying airplanes vastly more advanced than the primitive machines at the outset of the First World War

Back then in 1914 the fragile air forces of Europes opposing nations were little more than a sideshow But after four years of rapid innovation the first fighter airplanes were now efficient killing machines and their pilots celebrated knights of the air

The cost was horrific Thousands of airmen burned bright but died young The most famous and feared of all was Manfred von Richthofen

Now in April 1918 with 80 kills to his name von Richthofen is due to go home on leave But his final day of active duty will end in death clouded by mystery and controversy Only now has new evidence surfaced that may answer the question that has persisted for more than eighty years Who Killed the Red Baron Up next on NOVA

NARRATOR In 1917 the US entered World War I and the first American troops landed in France Eventually American arms would turn the tide against Germany but in the spring of 1918 the Germans launch one final offensive to break the stalemate of the trench war

On the morning of April 21st Manfred von Richthofen the Red Baron takes off with a formation of Fokker Dr 1 fighters Meanwhile a British Royal Air Force patrol of Sopwith Camel fighters is climbing high over the front lines A dogfight begins and Allied troops in the trenches below see a Sopwith Camel break away chased by a distinctive red Fokker triplane

The Red Baron pursues his quarry piloted by Lieutenant Wilfrid May deep into Allied territory But as the Baron prepares to strike a second Camel piloted by Captain Roy Brown dives steeply to intercept him Bursts of machine gun fire from ground and air erupt across the Somme Valley But instead of Lieutenant May spinning to his death it is the red triplane that has plummeted from the sky

Ten days before his 26th birthday Manfred von Richthofen is dead The great pilot and tactician had broken one of his own key rules pursuing a risky lowlevel chase into enemy territory

BARON HERMANN VON RICHTHOFEN Great Nephew of Manfred von Richtofen Manfred of course was a human being and a human being is not without faults And he had been very serious about the question of life and death and he must have known that one day he would be a victim himself

SUZANNE FISCHER Historian At the end he was feeling very fatalistic On his last leave his mother was going with him to a family gathering and he mentioned that he had a toothache She told him to go to the dentist and he said No it really doesnt matter anymore He knew then that he would never come back

NARRATOR A feeding frenzy of souvenir hunters scavenged the red triplane as rumors flew that von Richthofen was dead It was a huge propaganda coup for the Allies But who shot down the legendary Red Baron

That question has divided aviation buffs and historians for decades

Wasting no time RAF 209 Squadron pressed home the claim of their man Captain Roy Brown citing his combat report as evidence

CAPTAIN ROY BROWN RAF Pilot in written report I dived on a pure red triplane which was firing on Lieutenant May I got a long burst into him and he went down vertical and was observed to crash by Lieutenant May

DENNY MAY Son of Lieutenant Wilfrid May My dad was totally convinced to his dying day that Roy Brown was the person that shot down the Red Baron He never wavered from that nor did he have any facts to tell him any different from that

NARRATOR For his daring attack on von Richthofens tail Captain Roy Brown was officially credited by the Board of Inquiry with the famous kill The Canadian airman became celebrated as the pilot who shot down the Red Baron but there were dissenting voices Several Australian gunners claimed to have brought down the triplane when they fired on it from the Morlancourt Ridge overlooking the river Somme

On the day of his death several medical officers examined von Richthofens body The Baron had been killed by a single 303 bullet that entered below the right armpit and passed forward and up through his chest emerging just below the left nipple

On his return to base Captain Roy Brown discussed his attack with Lieutenant May the Barons intended victim

DENNY MAY Roy and my dad had talked and Roy had told him that he had brought his aircraft down at a very steep angle to intercept them as they were going along And he came in from behind and attacked made a quick pass at the Red Baron fired some shots and was out of the picture almost immediately

NARRATOR The crucial question that has perplexed investigators is whether Captain Brown attacking from above and behind could have fired the fatal shot And if Brown were not responsible which of the many Allied soldiers on the ground was in a position to have killed the legendary Red Baron

Manfred von Richthofen was born into minor Prussian nobility His father was a cavalry officer and young Manfred inherited the hunters appetite and instinct

BARON HERMANN VON RICHTHOFEN He had a very happy youth He was athletic he was strong he was joyful and he very much liked shooting riding swimmingall that young boys do

SUZANNE FISCHER His father used to take him hunting as a small boy and he was very successful even as a child His sister once said that he had the eyes of an eagle

NARRATOR His destiny seemed clear He would join the Imperial German Army where his athleticism and horsemanship would lead him into the cavalry

When the Great War began the traditional role for cavalry was reconnaissance But a new war demanded new tactics Stalemate between the trenches and miles of barbed wire soon made mounted troops obsolete So the new technology of aviation took on the vital role of spotting enemy trenches artillery and troop movements Aircraft became the eyes and ears of battle

BRADLEY M KING Imperial War Museum They were scouting pilots And of course there was some reticence from high commandespecially from the old cavalry officersthat aircraft would be of any use whatsoever And they were very much seen as something experimental something fancy and we will stick with the tradition thank you very much

NARRATOR But in only the second month of the war air reconnaissance revealed the hidden direction of the German advance on Paris The early air forces had proved their worth Yet these aircraft were still fragile underpowered and unarmed Pilots and observers took to the skies brandishing rifles and service revolvers The aerial arms race was about to begin

SIMON MOODY RAF Museum Hendon As they tended to meet aircraft in the air more often these pilots and observers decided to take it on themselves to have a pop As a soldier it was a natural thing to do to try and shoot at your enemy who after all is the opposing side and youre supposed to be killing

NARRATOR Stranded in the cavalry von Richthofen envied the exploits of the new knights of the air the young men who took to the skies to gather vital information for the ground forces below

BARON HERMANN VON RICHTHOFEN He got bored and he wanted to have a more exciting role in this war And he thought to be trained as a pilot would take much too long a time He wanted to have it now and therefore he was quite happy going on reconnaissance and bomber flights as a companion but not as a pilot

NARRATOR Von Richthofen transferred to the German Air Service and in May 1915 traveled to Cologne to join an observer flighttraining program

BARON MANFRED VON RICHTHOFEN The Red Baron German Air Service Pilot excerpt from his autobiography The Red Air Fighter I sat in an airplane for the first time The blast of wind from the propeller disturbed me greatly Everything flew away from me My flying jacket slipped off my muffler was too loose In short I was miserable

NARRATOR It was an unpromising debut But von Richthofen would soon get the chance to show his true talents his hunters instinct and deadly marksmanship

The machine gun had transformed the ground war Was there a way to somehow get it airborne

ALEX IMRIE Aviation Historian They had to devise some means of firing a gun through the rotating propeller rigidly fixed to the airplane so that it could be steered by steering the airplane And of course the big problem was propeller avoidance

NARRATOR The breakthrough came with a dashing young French aviator named Roland Garros already famous for winning a string of air races in the pioneer days before the war Now he had become a test pilot for Raymond Saulnier a leading aircraft designer

Saulnier was experimenting with various devices that would allow a gun to fire safely through the path of a rotating propeller One simple though crude solution was to fix metal deflector wedges to the propeller blades of his airplane

BRADLEY M KING The idea being that when the machine gun fired if a bullet hit the steel wedge it would be deflected away from the wooden propeller Sometimes it split the bullet sometimes it came back at you so this was gutsy stuff

NARRATOR In February 1915 Garros intercepted a German reconnaissance aircraft Within seconds he sent it burning to the ground The kill was followed by at least two more victories

ALEX IMRIE Garros absolutely confounded the Germans this airplane coming towards them with a rotating propeller they thought they were perfectly safe and suddenly it started spouting bullets So there was confusion in the ranks

NARRATOR But his success was brief Soon after his engine failed behind enemy lines and Garros was captured Meanwhile a brilliant young Dutch designer working for the Germans Anthony Fokker came up with an improved solution to the firing problem Capturing Garros aroused German interest in Fokkers work

Fokker thought the steel wedges were too crude and risky A better idea was a mechanism that linked the spinning of the propeller to the firing of the gun In a few weeks Fokker perfected his socalled interrupter gear an enginedriven system of cams and pushrods which operated the trigger of a Spandau machine gun The mechanism allowed the gun to fire only when the bullet would miss the propeller blades

Fokker had delivered to the Germans the Holy Grail of the air war a synchronized forwardfiring machine gun

ANDY SEPHTON Pilot Shuttleworth Collection You could put the line of the gun close to the line of the airplane directly in the pilots eye view So when he is actually pointing his airplane at the target he was effectively looking straight down the line of his gun

NARRATOR By the autumn of 1915 the German Air Service had the upper hand With their synchronized frontfiring gun the Fokker monoplanes or Eindekkers were arriving at the front with their ambitious young pilots Among them were Max Immelmann and Oswald Boelcke

PETER HART Imperial War Museum Boelcke and Immelmann did begin to learn the language of aerial warfare The aircraft wasnt that good but it was reasonably maneuverable reasonably fast and best of all it was great at diving and that was what they actually used to devise some of the early fighter tactics

NARRATOR The young German aces were admired and envied by Manfred von Richthofen who was still stuck as a gunner in twinengine bombers He wanted to become an aerial fighter like Oswald Boelcke

Then a chance encounter with his idol changed Manfreds life

BARON MANFRED VON RICHTHOFEN The Red Baron German Air Service Pilot excerpt from his autobiography The Red Air Fighter Among us Boelcke was the only one who had shot down an enemy airman I asked Tell me honestly how do you really do it To which he laughed and replied Good heavens it indeed is quite simple I fly in as close as I can take good aim shoot and then he falls down

NARRATOR Von Richthofen saw his destiny

BARON HERMANN VON RICHTHOFEN Boelcke told him If you want to have my experience you must fly and you must become a pilot And then he decided to go through the training and become a pilot

NARRATOR While von Richthofen learned to fly Boelcke and Immelmann were preying on Allied reconnaissance planes and inventing the first fighter tactics

HAUPTMANN OSWALD BOELCKE German Air Service pilot excerpt from Boelckes Dicta published in 1916 Try to place yourself between the sun and the enemy Attack when the enemy least expects it Never turn your back and try to run Foolish acts of bravery only bring death

PHILIP SABIN Kings College London Boelcke was really the father of aerial tactics The early years of the air war were the era of the lone hunters You had aces in particular who would go up hide in clouds look for a lone victim pounce try and take them by surprise and shoot them down

NARRATOR Slow twoseater spotter planes like the British BE2C were particularly vulnerable

BRADLEY M KING Beware of the Hun in the sun The British really had a problem on their hands They were being shot down to such an extent actually that the pilots were calling themselves Fokker fodder It was having an effect on morale and we really needed to come up with some idea of how to tackle this

NARRATOR To counter the threat Brigadier General Hugh Trenchard responded with a new tactic He ordered that all Allied reconnaissance planes had to be supported by at least three other armed aircraft

PETER HART People realized that they had to work together in the air they couldnt just fly willynilly about as they wished This was the whole idea of a formation You may have been weak on your own but in numbers you were strong

NARRATOR Greater safety in numbers gave the Allies a better chance But more aircraft in the skies meant an escalation of aerial combat or dogfighting

ANDY SEPHTON	There is one rule really which is to kill the other guy before he can kill you And if you can see him before he can see you then thats ninety percent of the battle over

NARRATOR As the Great War entered the spring of its third year both sides launched major offensives to break the stalemate between the trenches

First came the German push of Verdun then the Allied counteroffensive of the Somme Both failed Epic unrelenting slaughter would haunt a generation This was war unlike anything seen before

Eyes in the sky now counted more than ever to the armies on the ground New reconnaissance aircraft could transmit Morse code by wireless to the ground delivering realtime intelligence that could help turn a battle

PHILIP SABIN	The reconnaissance aircraft were the only ones that carried wireless during the first world war And they were willing to pay the very significant weight penalty involved for these fragile aircraft because of the tremendous military advantage it gave to be able to talk in real time to the artillery battery to coordinate their fight rather than having to spot the target and fly back and tell them where the target was by which time of course it could well be too late

NARRATOR Into this arena stepped Manfred von Richthofen Now qualified as a pilot he cut his teeth flying support sorties first in a twoseater then in an Eindekker fighter But as the carnage of Verdun and the Somme dragged on below Allied pilots began flying new speedy biplane fighters armed with synchronized machine guns The seesaw of technological advantage now swung back to the Allies

The Germans on the defensive needed a new plan All eyes looked to their top ace Oswald Boelcke

PHILIP SABIN	People like Boelcke had the idea of forming dedicated fighter groupsthe so called Jastas with the best pilots and the best machineswhich would go off and hunt the Allied aircraft and could be concentrated on particular sectors of the front so that even if the Germans were outnumbered overall at the key points and the key times they might have at least numerical parity if not sometimes superiority

NARRATOR Boelcke handpicked his flyers One was the young man hed inspired to become a fighter pilot Manfred von Richthofen Boelcke drilled his new protégés with his tactical principles His Jasta 2 squadron quickly notched up victory after victory

PHILIP SABIN	Boelcke was looking for aggressive capable pilots with the killer instinct that really characterizes all successful fighter pilots They needed to have the situational awareness to know what was going on around them in a dogfight They needed to have good marksmanship All those things I think he sawparticularly the marksmanship and the ruthlessnessin von Richthofen

NARRATOR Toward the end of 1916 the new Jastas were gaining the initiative With the arrival of the fast Albatros fighters in September German air supremacy was regained

Boelcke doubled his score to 40 victories But at the height of success he was killed in a midair collision with one of his own men A month later Boelckes successor was shot down by a British patrol Its leader the skillful ace Lanoe Hawker would soon be drawn into a fateful aerial duel His adversary was Manfred von Richthofen

In just two months Manfred had notched up his first ten kills Now the rising star took off in his Albatros and ambushed Hawkers DH2 squadron The wheel of fortune was about to turn again

SIMON MOODY I think you can see this combat as being the end of an era in a sense Its marking the end of the aerial superiority that the British had managed to achieve over the battlefields of the Somme The DH2 is incredibly maneuverable and Hawker obviously very talented Richthofen had the advantage of speed and armament so what then happened was a deadly game of tail chasing

BARON MANFRED VON RICHTHOFEN The Red Baron German Air Service Pilot excerpt from his autobiography The Red Air Fighter Both of us flying like madmen in a circle first left then right I was acutely aware that I was not dealing with a beginner Finally he tried to escape by flying in a zigzag course That gave me my chance My opponent fell shot through the head a mere 150 feet behind our line another few minutes and he might have escaped

BARON HERMANN VON RICHTHOFEN Here Manfred really found somebody who was matching him and he was the lucky one because in the end he could bring him down but he really respected his competence and talent

NARRATOR Hawker the daring British ace was buried beside the wreckage of his airplane He was von Richthofens eleventh kill

SUZANNE FISCHER He shot to kill whenever possible because that was the best way of eliminating an enemy If you shoot down the plane you still have to contend with the pilot but if you got the man then you got both

NARRATOR On January 10th 1917 Manfred von Richthofen was appointed leader of his own squadron Jasta 11 Fast gaining a fearsome reputation the new commander painted his Albatros bright red The legend of the Red Baron was born

BRADLEY M KING You needed to recognize each other And its from that that you start getting aircraft being painted either in squadron colors or in individual colors And for Richthofen to actually paint his aircraft completely redit did become a talisman

SUZANNE FISCHER One of the things that his men liked about him the best was that he would not let them down He was always there always watching always trying to get them to improve He would keep his eye on all of his men at the same time He could be engaged in a very difficult single combat yet when he came down on the ground he was able to tell each man what he had done right and what he had done wrong

NARRATOR Throughout the spring of 1917 the German Jastas wreaked havoc On the ground the Allies launched an attack on the stronghold of Vimy Ridge that cost both sides a total of some 30000 casualties

The killing in the air was equally brutal Allied reconnaissance and fighter support for the offensive below was annihilated In a single week of what became known as Bloody April the Royal Flying Corps lost 75 aircraft Its teenage pilots were often going into combat with as little as 18 hours flying time They learned fast or died

The life expectancy of a new pilot in 1917 was a matter of weeks Man for man the proportion of those killed in action in the skies may have even exceeded the carnage in the trenches below

ALEX IMRIE In the whole month they shot down 362 allied airplanes Richthofen and his men and chaps in other units they created havoc in April 17 The Royal Flying Corps never had such serious losses it was the worst month of the war for them

NARRATOR In Bloody April Allied losses in the skies outnumbered the Germans by four to one Von Richthofens personal tally was now 52 kills He was the leading ace of the war

PHILIP SABIN	He didnt mind having a kill which was completely defenseless Indeed he preferred it He would tend to avoid combat where he perceived any risk but he would go in when he thought he was able to achieve his kill He would go in very very close and fill the enemy with lead

NARRATOR In the wake of their severe losses the British began delivering new aircraft to the front the SE5A a fast and powerful climber the Sopwith Camel one of the most maneuverable fighters ever and the Bristol a versatile twoseater that could hold its own as a fighter The pendulum of war began to swing back to the Allies

PETER HART These aircraft were almost as good if not better than the Germans There was an essential parity of technology in the sky One British aircraft may have done something slightly better than another German aircraft but it was swings and roundabouts And from that time on the war in the air was more about numbers

NARRATOR The Germans couldnt replace aircraft as quickly as their opponents could so they tried a new tactic They combined Jasta squadrons into larger units that could be moved around to key pressure points on the front line These mobile fighter wings the famed flying circuses proved highly effective The first one was led by von Richthofen

BRADLEY M KING They were like a fire fighting service because they didnt have the numbers to be able to take on the British and the French everywhere along the line So what they did was they would pack up their aircraft go by road set up camp around three or four airfields around a town and fight until the danger was over and then move elsewhere So they were like a traveling circus

NARRATOR Despite the great success of the flying circus von Richthofen was no longer so sure of his own invincibility In a skirmish with British twoseaters the Baron suffered a severe head wound that nearly cost him his life

SUZANNE FISCHER The head wound affected his personality pretty severely He started to have headaches frequently depression Hed had a concussion of course and that affected his brain a little bit but he started to become a little more grouchy and for the first time he had a sense of his own mortality He knew that he was not going to survive the war

NARRATOR But in the remaining months of his life the Baron acquired a vital new combat advantage Anthony Fokker the designer had been working on a revolutionary new fighter aircraft the Dr 1 triplane In August 1917 he delivered it personally to von Richthofen The Dr 1s triple wing gave it the ability to climb rapidly and turn on a dime In von Richthofens skillful hands it was a lethal machine

PHILIP SABIN	It had tremendous advantages in maneuverability and von Richthofen would have liked it for that because he was able to fly it to its limit and make almost certain that nobody could ever get on his tail

NARRATOR As the war entered its fourth year the aerial arms race reached a climax
