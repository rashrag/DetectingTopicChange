Ken Hyde is more than a pilot.,2
He is also a historian of aviation.,2

Without the original diagrams Rick and Ken have to rely on the Wrights' century-old photographs.,3
"Ken, this is the only picture we have of the 1902 glider that shows the, uh, double moveable tail.",3
You think it would have...,1
The written records are very incomplete.,1
Orville and Wilbur were secretive by nature and always worried about people stealing their designs.,3
"Today, their secrets will have to be rediscovered.",3
"The Wrights were part of a tight-knit, mid-western family, eventually settling in Dayton, Ohio.",5
"Around 1878, Orville and Wilbur's father gave the boys their first flying machine.",6
"It was a children's toy, a rubber band model of an aircraft before there were aircraft.",6
"The brothers flew it, destroyed it and rebuilt it.",6
"They planned to fly a full-scale version, but Orville's grade school teacher wisely called a halt before any damage was done.",6
"In 1893, after years of working at various minor businesses, the brothers opened a small bicycle company.",6
Wilbur Wright is approaching thirty.,6
"He's sort of taken it easy in life, and I think he has the sense that if he's ever going to make his mark in the world, he's, this is the, the time to do it.",6
"And, so, he's, he's looking for the challenge that will, will do that for him.",6
"And, one of the great challenges, at the end of the 19th Century, is the airplane.",6
"Working from their bicycle shop, Orville and Wilbur Wright began a modest, but serious research project on manned flight.",6
"Starting with a few dollars and a Dayton Public Library card, they transformed their workshop into a laboratory of aeronautics.",6
Wilbur wrote a letter to the U.S.,6
Weather Bureau searching for a list of very windy locations.,6
"The bureau suggested the lonely Outer Banks of North Carolina, an isolated lifesaving station called Kitty Hawk.",6
It was here that they constructed a Spartan base camp on the dunes and began the experiments which would make them famous.,6
"At a modern workshop near Kitty Hawk, Rick and Ken's team is laboring to reproduce the Wrights' early experiments.",4
"Using the same wood and fabric, the same wire and fittings, they've started with the most basic of the Wrights' designs, man-carrying gliders.",4
I feel a lot of humility just working with the parts and pieces that we've been able to find.,4
It's absolutely amazing that they could do what they accomplished in such a short period of time.,4
"Now, if you take this off...okay, just kick it one time.",4
"See, that thing can get way over to one side.",4
"...in a, in a gust and all.",4
Yes.,0
"Unlike other dreamers and experimenters, before the Wrights even began their project, they broke the problem of flight into three distinct parts.",6
"If you think about an airplane, it really requires three separate systems, at least, to function.",6
"You have to have wings that will lift you into the air; you have to have a propulsion system that will move the wings through the air to generate lift; and you have to have a control system, a means of balancing the airplane when, when it's in the air.",6
The Wrights used their earliest gliders to work on the problem of lift how to get wood and fabric to seemingly defy gravity and rise into the air.,6
That's just what their pictures look like.,6
It is!,1
Yeah?,1
Fifteen's an average right now.,-1
"Okay, that's good right there.",-1
"Ten, fifteen.",-1
"Using an ordinary fisherman's scale, the Wrights were able to measure the amount of lift their wings were producing.",6
"Fifteen, twenty-two.",2
Creating lift was the most basic problem faced by the new field of aeronautical engineering.,6
"Aeronautical engineering, at the time of the Wrights, was simply a phrase that you could find in several books.",6
"Since it was dealing with a machine that is moving in three-dimensional space, one of those dimensions, of course, is up.",6
And you try to sustain the airplane in the air by creation of lift.,6
Any child who ever stuck a hand from a moving train would have realized that a strong wind pushing against her palm can produce lift.,6
"With a rounded top surface, the air passing over a wing travels farther and faster than the air underneath, becoming slightly less dense; the wing rises to fill this partial vacuum.",6
"This concept, known as Bernoulli's theorem, had been understood for 160 years, but Wilbur Wright quickly discovered there was little agreement on what the proper shape of a wing should be.",6
"What he discovered was that people had made wings that would lift: Otto Lilienthal had built gliders that carried him on over 2,000 flights through the air; Samuel Langley had built wings that carried his really rather heavy models through the air.",6
"So, uh, Wilbur Wright assumed that he could rely on those folks for his initial information on wings.",6
"In the 1890s, German experimenter Otto Lilienthal built a series of complex hang gliders.",7
"Ridiculed by cynics as a flying squirrel, Lilienthal based many of his designs on the curvature of birds' wings and tested them by jumping off a hill he constructed near Berlin.",7
"They assumed that since Lilienthal had flown rather well in his hang gliders, that, uh, the data on which he had based those gliders must be correct.",7
"And that was the basis for their, the design of their first two gliders in 1900 and 1901.",7
"Lilienthal died in the crash of one of his gliders, but his published research was believed to be accurate.",7
The Wrights built their first wings with the same cross-sections Lilienthal had used.,7
It's caught right there.,2
How about the top part?,2
"Hey, oh, wait a second.",2
That looks like a part of the problem.,2
"There's the problem, the top part, abandon the main.",2
"During a season of mysterious failures, the Wrights searched for a cause.",7
Their wings were not producing anywhere near the amount of lift Lilienthal's tables had predicted.,7
Wilbur began to suspect that the German's data was flawed.,7
Their lift was one-third of what they had been calculating on the basis of Otto Lilienthal's table.,7
"And they were so discouraged that they felt that the tables were definitely in error, and they made a very intellectually courageous decision to not use that data and to do everything on their own.",7
We have a shelter from the wind here.,4
Now this is the part...,2
"The Wrights knew that the wings that they had constructed were inefficient, but if they had to build a complete glider to study every slight change in wing shape, their part-time project could stretch on for decades.",7
"They could have built a great number of gliders with separate sorts of wing shapes and airfoils and that kind of thing, but, rather than doing that, they took a much smarter approach: they built a wind tunnel.",7
The wind tunnel itself is actually a fairly simple device.,7
"Rather than moving a wing forward through the air, flying the way you do with a glider, in a wind tunnel, you position it in one spot, down here, and you run air over the top of it.",7
"The tunnel itself, the device, is something anyone could have done.",7
"The balances, on the other hand, really illustrate the Wright brothers' genius.",7
"Constructed from a few ounces of scrap metal, the Wright balance is one of the most important experimental devices in the history of technology.",7
The simple apparatus let the Wrights quickly compare how much lift was produced by tiny metal wings mounted vertically on a wire frame.,7
"Experiments which would take weeks with a full-scale glider, could be completed in hours on the Wright balance.",7
"It's made out of hacksaw blades, bicycle spoke wire, simple pieces of material that they had around the bicycle shop.",7
"And yet, it's every bit as important to the story of the Wright brothers as the gliders that they flew at Kitty Hawk.",7
"With their balance, the Wrights tested hundreds of airfoil shapes, moving the thickest part of the wing forward from the middle up to the leading edge, changing the width of the wing and altering the angle it would bite the wind.",7
"The Wright brothers were able to gather pieces of aerodynamic data so accurate that modern engineers, working with multimillion dollar wind tunnel facilities, are only able to improve on it by a percentage point or two.",7
"Uh, keep that leading edge up.",7
Pilot Jay Grattan tests the improved wings designed in the Wright wind tunnel.,7
"The right wing...that's it, that's it, that's great.",7
"That's it, there we go.",7
More angle.,7
"Flying on a tether, in a good wind, a new glider generates just enough lift to overcome Jay's weight.",7
"That's it, that's it, that's it, good reaction.",7
"It would be nerve wracking, because I'm not sure about the capabilities of this machine, if they weren't holding on to it, but, you know, not yet, uh, not nerve wrecking yet, exciting.",7
It's gusting a little bit.,-1
That's beautiful.,2
"By 1902, the Wright brothers had solved the problem of lift; they had designed a wing which could fly.",7
"You're flying it, baby.",7
"The adventures on the dunes stimulated the Wrights' creativity, but there was more to flying than just lift.",7
"The great problem, really, that, uh, flying machine experimenters in the late 19th and early 20th century faced was the issue of control, and it was the Wright brothers' recognition of the fact that the control issue was going to be critical that initially set them apart from virtually everyone else.",7
"While most engineers assumed that a successful aircraft would need to be inherently stable, as bicycle builders, the Wrights made their living building vehicles which were inherently unstable.",7
They knew that a bicycle was stable only if the rider kept it under control.,7
"Most other experimenters in the field assumed that the control issue was going to be so difficult that the best approach they could take was to build an airplane that had maximum sort of automatic stability, an airplane that would fly in a straight line until the pilot made some sort of control input to change its direction, and then it would continue going in a straight, straight line again.",7
Early designers imagined aircraft as a kind of flying boat.,7
"If wind or waves rock a boat, it should be able to right itself.",7
"Instead of a boat, the Wrights thought of their flying machine more like a bicycle and rider: if the bike rolled to the left or right it was the job of the rider to keep it upright.",7
The Wrights didn't worry about building automatic stability into their airplanes anymore than they designed their bicycles to go without riders.,7
"As cyclists, the Wright brothers said to themselves, ""Well, if you tried to describe the act of riding a bicycle to someone who'd never seen one, um, what?",7
"You're going to roll down the street in this thing with two narrow rubber tires, and you're going to be balancing while you're operating the handle bars.""",7
"It would sound like the sort of feat that only the world's greatest acrobat could accomplish, and yet, they knew that once you learn how to ride a bike, you internalize that, and it becomes perfectly natural and instinctive; you don't even think about it.",7
And they were sure that the same thing would be true of a flying machine.,7
"Simple handle bars and body English could control a bicycle, but how could a pilot control a flying machine?",7
The story Wilbur told is that he was in the bicycle shop one day and a customer came in and asked for an inner tube which came in a rectangular box.,7
"Wilbur was just idly toying with the box and suddenly realized that if you could put a helical twist all the way across the two wings of a biplane, so that on one side that the, uh, tip would be pointed up and on the other side down, and again, you could put a twist across it like this, that would be a method of controlling the airplane in the roll axis.",7
And it's the system that ultimately came to be called wing warping.,7
Are the cables running pretty cleanly through the pulleys?,7
Yeah.,3
"In the gliders, the wing-warping was controlled by swiveling the pilot's hips.",6
"Cables transmitted the pilot's movements, twisting one wing up and the other down.",7
"Yep, that's good.",2
How about into the wind?,2
Are we all right as well?,2
"From the Wrights' first gliders through modern jets, aircraft are steered by banking left and right.",7
"Individually changing the shape of wings, either by warping or with modern ailerons, has become the basis of all controlled flight.",7
"Their idea of having an active control system coupled to human intelligence, so that, the human being was every bit a part of the machine and, so, in essence, it's the man that..., the airplane becomes, the manifestation of your mind.",7
I'm not going to.,-1
"Jay, uh...",-1
"After several flights on a tether, Jay Grattan is ready to try her first free flight in the reconstructed 1902 glider.",4
Okay.,-1
Here comes the wind.,-1
Wouldn't you know it?,-1
"Seventeen point eight, twenty, twenty, twenty-eight...",-1
Are we ready?,-1
"Yeah, let's go.",-1
Nineteen...,-1
The Wrights' 1902 glider had wings which could both lift and steer the craft.,7
"But controlling the plane by swiveling the hips isn't easy, and it can only be practiced in the air.",7
"Very, very, very good.",7
"With a good breeze, the Wrights' glider could stay aloft for over 600 feet.",7
"Oh, man, this is it.",5
"With their wings producing lift and their warping system allowing some control, the brothers had solved two of the three problems in building an airplane.",7
Beautiful!,2
"Oh, this is awesome!",2
Now the Wrights needed a way to sustain flight.,7
"A small gasoline engine could provide the horsepower, but it would take a propeller to actually move the plane through the air.",7
"At the Franklin Institute, in Philadelphia, Ken and Rick have borrowed a rare, original Wright brothers' propeller to learn its secrets.",4
"If the team is to build a Wright airplane, they need to be able to carve their own propellers.",4
They want to measure the antique blades' precise cross sections without damaging them.,4
They're in remarkable condition.,4
Man.,1
"This apparatus, used in the auto industry, is designed to measure a three-dimensional object and to record its shape on a computer.",1
Great.,1
"Okay, that tells us what we need to know.",1
"Looks good, yeah, just keep doing it all the way across, that'll be great.",4
Um hum.,1
The propeller was one of the great technical problems that the Wrights faced and solved.,7
"And, in fact, when you look at the way in which they did it, it really does sort of underscore the, the nature of their genius.",7
"People had been studying windmill blades since the 18th century, and people had been using propellers on ships throughout the 19th century, really, so the Wrights assumed that there was some sort of a theoretical base there that enables you to calculate propeller performance.",7
"When they went to look, they discovered that that theoretical base simply wasn't there, and they were going to have to do that themselves.",7
"The great breakthrough occurred when they stopped to think about the problem and said, essentially, ""Well, it's much like a wing: it's developing lift rather than moving forward through the air.",7
"It's rotating, and the lift becomes the thrust that moves the airplane forward.""",7
A Wright propeller was just a wing spinning in a circle.,7
The computer reveals the propeller's cross-sections are the same curves as a Wright wing.,7
"With this connection between propellers and wings, the Wrights had solved the fundamental riddle of propeller design.",7
"Now, the brothers managed to leapfrog all other theoretical work on aircraft propulsion.",7
"In the fall of 1903, the Wright brothers are at Kill Devil Hills, Wright Flyer, they're testing the engine, they're testing the propellers, cranking this thing up.",8
They're literally measuring the thrust put out by the engine/propeller combination.,8
They had calculated that they needed 90 pounds of thrust.,8
"When they measured the thrust, it was a spectacular 130 pounds.",8
Why?,4
"Because their propellers were so much more efficient than even they themselves felt and Wilbur wrote home that night to his family saying, ""Success assured,"" because of their propellers.",8
"But the Wright brothers kept their progress under wraps, concerned about high-profile competition.",9
"In Washington, Dr. Samuel Langley, with $50,000 in government backing, was putting the finishing touches on his massive flying machine, the aerodrome.",9
"Samuel Langley, the third Secretary of the Smithsonian, had conducted his experiments with model airplanes.",9
"So, when he went to build a full-scale aerodrome, as he called it, it was actually sort of the world's largest model airplane.",9
"It was a thing that was inherently stable it had some control, but he was actually going to come back and worry about control later.",9
"The first week of December, 1903, Dr. Langley's pilot, Charles Manley, attempted to launch his plane from a barge on the Potomac.",9
"The huge Aerodrome was catapulted down the rail and then, seconds later, broke apart and plunged into the icy river.",9
"Manley was saved from drowning, but, as the aircraft sank, so did the public's belief that powered flight would be possible.",9
"One week after Langley's wreck, working alone in the obscurity of Kitty Hawk, Orville and Wilbur Wright placed a wooden rail on the dunes and attempted their own powered flight.",9
"So when they got up that morning, they had to warm themselves up and cook a little breakfast.",9
"Orville set the camera up and pointed it at a spot beyond the end of the rail, where he thought the airplane might be if it actually left the rail.",9
And he put a Coast Guardsman named John Daniels in charge of the camera and told him just to squeeze the bulb if he saw the airplane leave the track.,9
"The brothers kind of pulled off by themselves for a minute, and, uh, just talked quietly.",9
"Orville climbs onto the airplane, and when everything's ready to go he has Wilbur on the right wingtip to kind of keep it balanced...and Orville flipped the clip open, and down they went into the air.",9
The first flight was 120 feet in 12 seconds.,9
"Each flight was a little longer than the one before it, but it really wasn't until the fourth flight uh, Wilbur's flight that they really flew far enough to prove to themselves that they had achieved sustained flight.",9
"They flew down the beach in 59 seconds, and it was real impressive.",9
"There aren't many days that you can actually identify when history changes, but December 17th, 1903, was one of those days, because it was the day on which an airplane flew for the very first time.",9
"After dinner, Orville hiked down to the telegraph office and sent a brief message to his father announcing the birth of aviation and assuring him they would be home for Christmas.",9
"Back home in Dayton, the following spring, the Wright brothers set out to perfect their invention.",9
A small meadow on the edge of town became the world's first airport.,11
"In 1904 and 1905, Huffman Prairie, this little cow pasture, in the middle of Ohio farm country, was really the only place in the entire world where you could see an airplane fly.",11
"Cautiously, a few members of the national press ventured out to the prairie.",11
One of the first reporters who came to Dayton to investigate the story of the Wright brothers went around to interview the various families who had seen the Wrights actually operating their machine in the air over Huffman Prairie.,11
"And one of them had a small boy, and the reporter asked the boy if he had seen the airplane fly and what it had been like, to which the kid responded by putting his arms out and running around the room going like this, making airplane noises.",11
"And it struck me, when I first ran across that account, that that must have been the first time in the history of the world when a child had, had demonstrated the flight of an airplane in that way.",11
The Wright brothers had managed to turn their own childhood fascination with flight into a reality.,11
"Within a year of their first short hops at Kitty Hawk, the Wrights had built airplanes capable of thirty minute flights.",11
"With success, their lives began to change.",11
Wilbur made his first trip to Europe where he demonstrated his astounding machine before presidents and kings.,11
The brothers were becoming the first new celebrities of the 20th century.,11
This sudden change from mid-western bicycle mechanic to international luminary is revealed to Ken Hyde in the brothers' own banking records.,11
