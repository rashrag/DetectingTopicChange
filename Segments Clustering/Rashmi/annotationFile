NARRATOR: April 20th, 1918: In the skies over northern France, Allied and German fighter aircraft are locked in a ferocious dogfight.
 One of the contenders in this aerial battle is the legendary German ace, Manfred von Richthofen: the Red Baron.
His distinctive red Fokker triplane is in hot pursuit over the Somme Valley; in its sights are two British Sopwith Camel fighters.
 First one, and then the second are swiftly eliminated by the deadly marksman.
They are the 79th and 80th kills of the Red Baron's career.
Protecting German reconnaissance flights, Manfred von Richthofen, Germany's greatest ace, has brought his feared "flying circus" up to the front.
Opposing them are Royal Air Force squadrons flying the Sopwith Camel, one of the nimblest fighters ever built.
Back then, in 1914, the fragile air forces of Europe's opposing nations were little more than a sideshow.
But after four years of rapid innovation, the first fighter airplanes were now efficient killing machines and their pilots, celebrated "knights of the air."
The cost was horrific.
Thousands of airmen burned bright but died young.
The most famous and feared of all was Manfred von Richthofen.
 entered World War I, and the first American troops landed in France
 Eventually, American arms would turn the tide against Germany, but in the spring of 1918, the Germans launch one final offensive to break the stalemate of the trench war
On the morning of April 21st, Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron, takes off with a formation of Fokker Dr 1 fighters
 Meanwhile, a British Royal Air Force patrol of Sopwith Camel fighters is climbing high over the front lines
 A dogfight begins and Allied troops in the trenches below see a Sopwith Camel break away, chased by a distinctive red Fokker triplane
The Red Baron pursues his quarry, piloted by Lieutenant Wilfrid May, deep into Allied territory
 But as the Baron prepares to strike, a second Camel piloted by Captain Roy Brown dives steeply to intercept him
 Bursts of machine gun fire from ground and air erupt across the Somme Valley
 But instead of Lieutenant May spinning to his death, it is the red triplane that has plummeted from the sky
Ten days before his 26th birthday, Manfred von Richthofen is dead
 The great pilot and tactician had broken one of his own key rules, pursuing a risky low-level chase into enemy territory
BARON HERMANN VON RICHTHOFEN (Great Nephew of Manfred von Richtofen): Manfred, of course, was a human being, and a human being is not without faults
 And he had been very serious about the question of life and death, and he must have known that one day he would be a victim himself
SUZANNE FISCHER (Historian): At the end he was feeling very fatalistic
 On his last leave, his mother was going with him to a family gathering and he mentioned that he had a toothache
 She told him to go to the dentist, and he said, "No, it really doesn't matter anymore
 He knew then that he would never come back
NARRATOR: A feeding frenzy of souvenir hunters scavenged the red triplane as rumors flew that von Richthofen was dead
 It was a huge propaganda coup for the Allies
 But who shot down the legendary Red Baron?
That question has divided aviation buffs and historians for decades
Wasting no time, RAF 209 Squadron pressed home the claim of their man, Captain Roy Brown, citing his combat report as evidence
CAPTAIN ROY BROWN (RAF Pilot, in written report): I dived on a pure red triplane which was firing on Lieutenant May
 I got a long burst into him, and he went down vertical and was observed to crash by Lieutenant May
DENNY MAY (Son of Lieutenant Wilfrid May): My dad was totally convinced, to his dying day, that Roy Brown was the person that shot down the Red Baron
 He never wavered from that, nor did he have any facts to tell him any different from that
NARRATOR: For his daring attack on von Richthofen's tail, Captain Roy Brown was officially credited by the Board of Inquiry with the famous kill
 The Canadian airman became celebrated as the pilot who shot down the Red Baron, but there were dissenting voices
 Several Australian gunners claimed to have brought down the triplane when they fired on it from the Morlancourt Ridge overlooking the river Somme
On the day of his death, several medical officers examined von Richthofen's body
 The Baron had been killed by a single
303 bullet that entered below the right armpit and passed forward and up through his chest, emerging just below the left nipple
On his return to base, Captain Roy Brown discussed his attack with Lieutenant May, the Baron's intended victim
DENNY MAY: Roy and my dad had talked, and Roy had told him that he had brought his aircraft down at a very steep angle to intercept them as they were going along
 And he came in from behind and attacked, made a quick pass at the Red Baron, fired some shots and was out of the picture almost immediately
NARRATOR: The crucial question that has perplexed investigators is whether Captain Brown, attacking from above and behind, could have fired the fatal shot
 And if Brown were not responsible, which of the many Allied soldiers on the ground was in a position to have killed the legendary Red Baron?
Manfred von Richthofen was born into minor Prussian nobility
 His father was a cavalry officer and young Manfred inherited the hunter's appetite and instinct
BARON HERMANN VON RICHTHOFEN: He had a very happy youth
 He was athletic, he was strong, he was joyful, and he very much liked shooting, riding, swimming—all that young boys do
SUZANNE FISCHER: His father used to take him hunting as a small boy, and he was very successful, even as a child
 His sister once said that he had the eyes of an eagle
NARRATOR: His destiny seemed clear
 He would join the Imperial German Army, where his athleticism and horsemanship would lead him into the cavalry
When the Great War began, the traditional role for cavalry was reconnaissance
 But a new war demanded new tactics
 Stalemate between the trenches and miles of barbed wire soon made mounted troops obsolete
 So the new technology of aviation took on the vital role of spotting enemy trenches, artillery and troop movements
 Aircraft became the eyes and ears of battle
BRADLEY M
 KING (Imperial War Museum): They were scouting pilots
 And of course there was some reticence from high command—especially from the old cavalry officers—that aircraft would be of any use whatsoever
 And they were very much seen as something experimental, something fancy, and, "we will stick with the tradition, thank you very much
NARRATOR: But in only the second month of the war, air reconnaissance revealed the hidden direction of the German advance on Paris
 The early air forces had proved their worth
 Yet these aircraft were still fragile, underpowered and unarmed
 Pilots and observers took to the skies brandishing rifles and service revolvers
 The aerial arms race was about to begin
SIMON MOODY (RAF Museum, Hendon): As they tended to meet aircraft in the air more often, these pilots and observers decided to take it on themselves to have a pop
 As a soldier, it was a natural thing to do, to try and shoot at your enemy who, after all, is the opposing side and you're supposed to be killing
NARRATOR: Stranded in the cavalry, von Richthofen envied the exploits of the new knights of the air, the young men who took to the skies to gather vital information for the ground forces below
BARON HERMANN VON RICHTHOFEN: He got bored, and he wanted to have a more exciting role in this war
 And he thought to be trained as a pilot would take much too long a time
 He wanted to have it now, and therefore he was quite happy going on reconnaissance and bomber flights as a companion but not as a pilot
NARRATOR: Von Richthofen transferred to the German Air Service and in May, 1915, traveled to Cologne to join an observer flight-training program
BARON MANFRED VON RICHTHOFEN (The Red Baron, German Air Service Pilot, excerpt from his autobiography The Red Air Fighter): I sat in an airplane for the first time
 The blast of wind from the propeller disturbed me greatly
 Everything flew away from me
 My flying jacket slipped off, my muffler was too loose
 In short, I was miserable
NARRATOR: It was an unpromising debut
 But von Richthofen would soon get the chance to show his true talents, his hunter's instinct and deadly marksmanship
The machine gun had transformed the ground war
 Was there a way to somehow get it airborne?
ALEX IMRIE (Aviation Historian): They had to devise some means of firing a gun through the rotating propeller, rigidly fixed to the airplane so that it could be steered by steering the airplane
 And of course the big problem was propeller avoidance
NARRATOR: The breakthrough came with a dashing young French aviator named Roland Garros, already famous for winning a string of air races in the pioneer days before the war
 Now he had become a test pilot for Raymond Saulnier, a leading aircraft designer
Saulnier was experimenting with various devices that would allow a gun to fire safely through the path of a rotating propeller
 One simple, though crude solution was to fix metal deflector wedges to the propeller blades of his airplane
BRADLEY M
 KING: The idea being that when the machine gun fired, if a bullet hit the steel wedge, it would be deflected away from the wooden propeller
 Sometimes it split the bullet, sometimes it came back at you, so this was gutsy stuff
NARRATOR: In February 1915, Garros intercepted a German reconnaissance aircraft
 Within seconds he sent it burning to the ground
 The kill was followed by at least two more victories
ALEX IMRIE: Garros absolutely confounded the Germans, this airplane coming towards them with a rotating propeller, they thought they were perfectly safe, and suddenly it started spouting bullets
 So there was confusion in the ranks
NARRATOR: But his success was brief
 Soon after, his engine failed behind enemy lines and Garros was captured
 Meanwhile, a brilliant young Dutch designer working for the Germans, Anthony Fokker, came up with an improved solution to the firing problem
 Capturing Garros aroused German interest in Fokker's work
Fokker thought the steel wedges were too crude and risky
 A better idea was a mechanism that linked the spinning of the propeller to the firing of the gun
 In a few weeks Fokker perfected his so-called "interrupter" gear, an engine-driven system of cams and push-rods which operated the trigger of a Spandau machine gun
 The mechanism allowed the gun to fire only when the bullet would miss the propeller blades
Fokker had delivered to the Germans the Holy Grail of the air war: a synchronized forward-firing machine gun
ANDY SEPHTON (Pilot, Shuttleworth Collection): You could put the line of the gun close to the line of the airplane, directly in the pilot's eye view
 So when he is actually pointing his airplane at the target, he was effectively looking straight down the line of his gun
NARRATOR: By the autumn of 1915, the German Air Service had the upper hand
 With their synchronized front-firing gun, the Fokker monoplanes or "Eindekkers" were arriving at the front with their ambitious young pilots
 Among them were Max Immelmann and Oswald Boelcke
PETER HART (Imperial War Museum): Boelcke and Immelmann did begin to learn the language of aerial warfare
 The aircraft wasn't that good, but it was reasonably maneuverable, reasonably fast and best of all, it was great at diving, and that was what they actually used to devise some of the early fighter tactics
NARRATOR: The young German aces were admired and envied by Manfred von Richthofen, who was still stuck as a gunner in twin-engine bombers
 He wanted to become an aerial fighter like Oswald Boelcke
Then a chance encounter with his idol changed Manfred's life
BARON MANFRED VON RICHTHOFEN (The Red Baron, German Air Service Pilot, excerpt from his autobiography The Red Air Fighter): Among us, Boelcke was the only one who had shot down an enemy airman
 I asked, "Tell me honestly, how do you really do it?" To which he laughed and replied, "Good heavens, it indeed is quite simple
 I fly in as close as I can, take good aim, shoot, and then he falls down
NARRATOR: Von Richthofen saw his destiny
BARON HERMANN VON RICHTHOFEN: Boelcke told him, "If you want to have my experience, you must fly, and you must become a pilot
 And then he decided to go through the training and become a pilot
NARRATOR: While von Richthofen learned to fly, Boelcke and Immelmann were preying on Allied reconnaissance planes and inventing the first fighter tactics
HAUPTMANN OSWALD BOELCKE (German Air Service pilot, excerpt from "Boelcke's Dicta," published in 1916): "Try to place yourself between the sun and the enemy
 Attack when the enemy least expects it
 Never turn your back and try to run
 Foolish acts of bravery only bring death
PHILIP SABIN (King's College, London): Boelcke was really the father of aerial tactics
 The early years of the air war were the era of the lone hunters
 You had aces, in particular, who would go up, hide in clouds, look for a lone victim, pounce, try and take them by surprise and shoot them down
NARRATOR: Slow two-seater spotter planes like the British BE2C were particularly vulnerable
BRADLEY M
 KING: "Beware of the Hun in the sun
 The British really had a problem on their hands
 They were being shot down to such an extent, actually, that the pilots were calling themselves "Fokker fodder
 It was having an effect on morale, and we really needed to come up with some idea of how to tackle this
NARRATOR: To counter the threat, Brigadier General Hugh Trenchard responded with a new tactic
 He ordered that all Allied reconnaissance planes had to be supported by at least three other armed aircraft
PETER HART: People realized that they had to work together in the air; they couldn't just fly willy-nilly about as they wished
 This was the whole idea of a formation
 You may have been weak on your own, but in numbers you were strong
NARRATOR: Greater safety in numbers gave the Allies a better chance
 But more aircraft in the skies meant an escalation of aerial combat, or dogfighting
"ANDY SEPHTON:	There is one rule really, which is to kill the other guy before he can kill you"
 And if you can see him before he can see you, then that's ninety percent of the battle over
NARRATOR: As the Great War entered the spring of its third year, both sides launched major offensives to break the stalemate between the trenches
First came the German push of Verdun, then the Allied counter-offensive of the Somme
 Both failed
 Epic, unrelenting slaughter would haunt a generation
 This was war unlike anything seen before
Eyes in the sky now counted more than ever to the armies on the ground
 New reconnaissance aircraft could transmit Morse code by wireless to the ground, delivering real-time intelligence that could help turn a battle
"PHILIP SABIN:	The reconnaissance aircraft were the only ones that carried wireless during the first world war"
 And they were willing to pay the very significant weight penalty involved for these fragile aircraft, because of the tremendous military advantage it gave to be able to talk in real time to the artillery battery, to coordinate their fight, rather than having to spot the target and fly back and tell them where the target was, by which time, of course, it could well be too late
NARRATOR: Into this arena stepped Manfred von Richthofen
 Now qualified as a pilot, he cut his teeth flying support sorties, first in a two-seater, then in an Eindekker fighter
 But, as the carnage of Verdun and the Somme dragged on below, Allied pilots began flying new, speedy biplane fighters armed with synchronized machine guns
 The seesaw of technological advantage now swung back to the Allies
The Germans, on the defensive, needed a new plan
 All eyes looked to their top ace, Oswald Boelcke
"PHILIP SABIN:	People like Boelcke had the idea of forming dedicated fighter groups—the so called ""Jastas,"" with the best pilots and the best machines—which would go off and hunt the Allied aircraft and could be concentrated on particular sectors of the front, so that even if the Germans were outnumbered overall, at the key points and the key times they might have at least numerical parity if not, sometimes, superiority"
NARRATOR: Boelcke hand-picked his flyers
 One was the young man he'd inspired to become a fighter pilot, Manfred von Richthofen
 Boelcke drilled his new protégés with his tactical principles
 His Jasta 2 squadron quickly notched up victory after victory
"PHILIP SABIN:	Boelcke was looking for aggressive, capable pilots with the killer instinct that really characterizes all successful fighter pilots"
 They needed to have the situational awareness to know what was going on around them in a dogfight
 They needed to have good marksmanship
 All those things I think he saw—particularly the marksmanship and the ruthlessness—in von Richthofen
NARRATOR: Toward the end of 1916, the new Jastas were gaining the initiative
 With the arrival of the fast Albatros fighters in September, German air supremacy was regained
Boelcke doubled his score to 40 victories
 But at the height of success, he was killed in a mid-air collision with one of his own men
 A month later, Boelcke's successor was shot down by a British patrol
 Its leader, the skillful ace Lanoe Hawker, would soon be drawn into a fateful aerial duel
 His adversary was Manfred von Richthofen
In just two months, Manfred had notched up his first ten kills
 Now the rising star took off in his Albatros and ambushed Hawker's DH2 squadron
 The wheel of fortune was about to turn again
SIMON MOODY: I think you can see this combat as being the end of an era in a sense
 It's marking the end of the aerial superiority that the British had managed to achieve over the battlefields of the Somme
 The DH2 is incredibly maneuverable and Hawker, obviously very talented
 Richthofen had the advantage of speed and armament, so what then happened was a deadly game of tail chasing
BARON MANFRED VON RICHTHOFEN (The Red Baron, German Air Service Pilot, excerpt from his autobiography The Red Air Fighter): Both of us flying like madmen in a circle, first left then right
 I was acutely aware that I was not dealing with a beginner
 Finally, he tried to escape by flying in a zigzag course
 That gave me my chance
 My opponent fell, shot through the head, a mere 150 feet behind our line, another few minutes and he might have escaped
BARON HERMANN VON RICHTHOFEN: Here Manfred really found somebody who was matching him, and he was the lucky one because in the end he could bring him down, but he really respected his competence and talent
NARRATOR: Hawker, the daring British ace, was buried beside the wreckage of his airplane
 He was von Richthofen's eleventh kill
SUZANNE FISCHER: He shot to kill whenever possible, because that was the best way of eliminating an enemy
 If you shoot down the plane, you still have to contend with the pilot, but if you got the man, then you got both
NARRATOR: On January 10th, 1917, Manfred von Richthofen was appointed leader of his own squadron, Jasta 11
 Fast gaining a fearsome reputation, the new commander painted his Albatros bright red
 The legend of the Red Baron was born
BRADLEY M
 KING: You needed to recognize each other
 And it's from that, that you start getting aircraft being painted either in squadron colors or in individual colors
 And for Richthofen to actually paint his aircraft completely red
it did become a talisman
SUZANNE FISCHER: One of the things that his men liked about him the best was that he would not let them down
 He was always there, always watching, always trying to get them to improve
 He would keep his eye on all of his men at the same time
 He could be engaged in a very difficult single combat, yet, when he came down on the ground, he was able to tell each man what he had done right and what he had done wrong
NARRATOR: Throughout the spring of 1917, the German Jastas wreaked havoc
 On the ground, the Allies launched an attack on the stronghold of Vimy Ridge that cost both sides a total of some 30,000 casualties
The killing in the air was equally brutal
 Allied reconnaissance and fighter support for the offensive below was annihilated
 In a single week of what became known as "Bloody April," the Royal Flying Corps lost 75 aircraft
 Its teenage pilots were often going into combat with as little as 18 hours flying time
 They learned fast or died
The life expectancy of a new pilot in 1917 was a matter of weeks
 Man for man, the proportion of those killed in action in the skies may have even exceeded the carnage in the trenches below
ALEX IMRIE: In the whole month they shot down 362 allied airplanes
 Richthofen and his men, and chaps in other units, they created havoc in April '17
 The Royal Flying Corps never had such serious losses; it was the worst month of the war for them
NARRATOR: In Bloody April, Allied losses in the skies outnumbered the Germans' by four to one
 Von Richthofen's personal tally was now 52 kills
 He was the leading ace of the war
"PHILIP SABIN:	He didn't mind having a kill which was completely defenseless"
 Indeed, he preferred it
 He would tend to avoid combat where he perceived any risk, but he would go in when he thought he was able to achieve his kill
 He would go in very, very close and fill the enemy with lead
NARRATOR: In the wake of their severe losses, the British began delivering new aircraft to the front: the SE5A, a fast and powerful climber; the Sopwith Camel, one of the most maneuverable fighters ever; and the Bristol, a versatile two-seater that could hold its own as a fighter
 The pendulum of war began to swing back to the Allies
PETER HART: These aircraft were almost as good if not better than the Germans'
 There was an essential parity of technology in the sky
 One British aircraft may have done something slightly better than another German aircraft, but it was swings and roundabouts
 And from that time on the war in the air was more about numbers
NARRATOR: The Germans couldn't replace aircraft as quickly as their opponents could, so they tried a new tactic
 They combined Jasta squadrons into larger units that could be moved around to key pressure points on the front line
 These mobile fighter wings, the famed "flying circuses," proved highly effective
 The first one was led by von Richthofen
BRADLEY M
 KING: They were like a fire fighting service, because they didn't have the numbers to be able to take on the British and the French everywhere along the line
 So what they did was, they would pack up their aircraft, go by road, set up camp around three or four airfields around a town, and fight until the danger was over and then move elsewhere
 So they were like a traveling circus
NARRATOR: Despite the great success of the "flying circus," von Richthofen was no longer so sure of his own invincibility
 In a skirmish with British two-seaters, the Baron suffered a severe head wound that nearly cost him his life
SUZANNE FISCHER: The head wound affected his personality pretty severely
 He started to have headaches frequently, depression
 He'd had a concussion, of course, and that affected his brain a little bit, but he started to become a little more grouchy, and for the first time he had a sense of his own mortality
 He knew that he was not going to survive the war
NARRATOR: But in the remaining months of his life, the Baron acquired a vital new combat advantage
 Anthony Fokker, the designer, had been working on a revolutionary new fighter aircraft, the Dr 1 triplane
 In August 1917, he delivered it, personally, to von Richthofen
 The Dr 1's triple wing gave it the ability to climb rapidly and turn on a dime
 In von Richthofen's skillful hands, it was a lethal machine
"PHILIP SABIN:	It had tremendous advantages in maneuverability and von Richthofen would have liked it for that, because he was able to fly it to its limit and make almost certain that nobody could ever get on his tail"
NARRATOR: As the war entered its fourth year, the aerial arms race reached a climax
War had transformed the fragile flying machines of 1914 into high-powered, heavily armed fighter airplanes
 By 1918, the skies above the western front witnessed a terrifying dance of death
BRADLEY M
 KING: This is the era of the dogfight
 And some pilots said, actually, that by 1918, if there weren't sixty aircraft involved, you couldn't call it a dogfight
 A great swirling beehive of activity and danger, in a box of air a mile square—quite an extraordinary sight to see
NARRATOR: Such deadly aerial warfare was unimaginable back in 1905, when the Wright brothers' offer to develop a military aircraft had been rejected
 The United States had fewer than 300 unarmed airplanes when President Wilson declared war on Germany in April 1917
It took a year before regular U
S
 squadrons arrived at the front, flying mostly French-built fighters
 Two American squadrons flew British Sopwith Camels and were attached to the RAF
 Aces like Eddie Rickenbacker would soon become America's first war heroes of the air
Germany was determined to counter the mounting Allied threat before American arms could prove decisive
 The final German offensive of the war began in the spring of 1918
 More than ever, the German forces relied on their mobile flying circuses to clear Allied planes from the skies
The Baron's own circus was soon in action, and on Saturday, April 20th, von Richthofen scored his 79th and 80th kills, shooting down two Sopwith Camels
Billeted at this small chateau, von Richthofen was just two days from going on leave
 But, fatefully, he had one more day of flying combat
The morning of Sunday, April 21st, 1918, was unusual
 The wind, which normally ensured that most air combat occurred over German lines, had reversed direction
 At 9:45, the Baron took off with two small formations of Fokker triplanes
A little after 10:40, they spot a patrol of five Sopwith Camel fighters from RAF 209 Squadron and turn to face them
 As the dogfight begins, two novice pilots, one German, one Allied, are under strict instructions to remain above the fray—von Richthofen is babysitting his young cousin Wolfram
 Likewise, Wilfrid May, a new recruit from Canada, has been ordered by Captain Roy Brown not to engage the enemy
DENNY MAY: Roy told him to not get involved in any fight, to get up on top, watch, get used to seeing other aircraft in the air, don't do anything stupid, and come back alive
 He was frightened out of his mind, I'm sure, at that point
NARRATOR: As fighting erupts, May stays above the combat as instructed
 But when he sees a triplane tantalizingly close, adrenaline takes hold and he decides to attack
 The pilot is Wolfram von Richthofen
But the Red Baron's eagle eye quickly spots the danger
 Suddenly finding himself under attack, May breaks away from the fight and dives desperately for home
 Sensing his 81st victory, von Richthofen closes in to get behind May
 Eyewitnesses on the ground spot the two fighters heading down the Somme Valley
Moments later, a third airplane is seen: it is Captain Roy Brown, giving chase to protect his young recruit
 Von Richthofen attacks
 Although the Camel can fly faster than the triplane, May shows his inexperience by zigzagging, which slows him down
DENNY MAY: He was doing things that probably you shouldn't do with an aircraft
 He was really frightened at that point and didn't know what to do
 So he started flying very erratically
 He was doing tight turns
 He was zooming around trees, very
down very close to the river
NARRATOR: Von Richthofen fires again, but at least one of his guns jams, and May is reprieved
Now over Allied territory, ground gunners are trying to get the red triplane in their sights
 Over the village of Vaux, both planes narrowly miss the church belfry
 Meanwhile, Captain Brown dives steeply to make his attack on the Baron
 He unleashes a quick burst of fire and pulls up and away sharply to avoid hitting the ground
The Baron continues his pursuit of May up the steep slope of the Morlancourt Ridge
 Over the crest of the ridge, Australian gunners Buie and Evans let rip with their Lewis machine guns
 And just below the crest of the ridge, another Australian, Sergeant Cedric Popkin swings his Vickers machine gun into action
The red triplane makes a sharp turn back toward the German lines, then stalls and lands roughly in a nearby field
 Lieutenant May is saved
DENNY MAY: There was a cloud of dust, and then, at that point, my dad quickly flew over the scene, and then headed back to Bertangles to the aerodrome
NARRATOR: Manfred von Richthofen, the greatest ace of World War I, was dead, shot through the chest by a single bullet
Why did Germany's master tactician break his own rules, pursuing Wilfrid May far into enemy territory, low down and all alone?
A crucial factor may have been the change in the wind direction
 Instead of the normal west to east, it had turned east to west and it probably carried von Richthofen over the Allied lines far more quickly than he anticipated
BRADLEY M
 KING: It's very easy to get incredibly disorientated when you are that low down, because all your landmarks have gone
 You can't see that village
 You can't see that church spire
 You can't see the enemy battery over there
"PHILIP SABIN:	Von Richthofen is at fault in not watching behind him and taking care of his own security as he usually did"
 It's a case of target fixation
 And he's got tunnel vision, focused exclusively on his target
SUZANNE FISCHER: I think he broke his own rules because he was suffering from post-traumatic stress, and he didn't care anymore
 He didn't really want to fight, but he was not able to let himself be taken away from combat
 He didn't want to shirk his duty so he just let whatever happened, happen
BARON HERMANN VON RICHTHOFEN: Yes, he disobeyed his own rules for reasons which we do not know, which we cannot pursue nowadays, but he did, and he paid for it with his life
NARRATOR: Von Richthofen's uncharacteristic errors have perplexed scholars, but above all, controversy continues over who brought him down
 The RAF officially credited the kill to Captain Roy Brown of 209 Squadron
 But was it, in fact, a bullet from Brown that struck the Baron?
DENNY MAY: My dad didn't see Roy Brown attack the Red Baron's aircraft
 All he saw was that the Red Baron all of a sudden turned away and broke off the fight
 After he talked to Roy, and Roy said, "I came in and I shot at the aircraft," he said, "Then you saved my life
NARRATOR: Von Richthofen's body was taken to an RAF base at Poulainville where several medical examinations were carried out
 They showed that he had been mortally wounded by a single
303 bullet that entered several inches below the right armpit and passed up through the chest, emerging just below the left nipple
 Both Allied aircraft and ground gunners used the same
303 ammunition
The direction, distance and timing of this fatal shot are vital clues that have been constantly debated
 Starting from the medical reports, author and aviation historian Norman Franks has been re-investigating the mystery
NORMAN FRANKS (Aviation Historian): Once we looked at the pathology, we interviewed two or three eminent pathologists, and they said that the sort of wound that he would have suffered would have given him no more than 12 to 20 seconds of life once he was hit—just enough to get down
ALEX IMRIE: I've spoken
I've asked a few pilots about this—those that were there—and one in particular, Rudolph Stark, a Bavarian, he was flying that morning, and he reckons that Richthofen was still alive when he landed because he said the triplane was so touchy to fly, it was absolutely impossible for it to land smoothly on its own
NARRATOR: Although mortally wounded, had von Richthofen somehow managed to wrestle his aircraft safely to the ground? Eighty years after the event, an important new piece of evidence surfaced in a letter from the son of an Allied soldier who claimed to be the first to reach the crashed triplane
SON OF GUNNER ERNEST TWYCROSS (Excerpt from 1973 letter): My father's officer sent my father down to take the pilot prisoner, which my father did
 My father was the first man to the aircraft and the pilot tried to say something in German to my father
 The pilot then sighed and died
BRADLEY M
 KING: This added a whole new dimension to the final moments of Richthofen's life and confirmed that the aircraft came down intact
 It was practically flown down
 Richthofen was still alive, which nobody had known about before
NARRATOR: If von Richthofen was still alive on the ground, the shooter must have fired at him no more than 20 seconds or so before he landed
 Was Captain Brown at the right spot and at the right angle to have fired the fatal shot?
A second new piece of evidence now emerged
 It was a large collection of correspondence from the 1930s between a former World War II RAF officer and surviving witnesses of the Baron's last flight
 It had lain neglected for 60 years
In the collection was a letter from an Australian engineer called Darbyshire who was watching the action from the Somme canal
 Crucially, he was in a position to see both von Richthofen and Captain Brown
SERGEANT GAVIN DARBYSHIRE (Excerpt from 1937 letter): I turned to look at the two leading planes just going over the ridge, heard a burst of gunfire, and the Fokker stopped in its stride and did the first half of a loop, then straightened out and fluttered down out of sight as if doing a pancake landing
 By this time the third plane was just approaching the ridge
 I was amazed later to hear that the Hun was brought down by a plane, as the chaser was not firing at the time the German stopped
NARRATOR: Darbyshire's statement was a vital clue
NORMAN FRANKS: He saw the triplane coming back over the ridge rear-up and then crunch down in a forced landing
 That, to us, indicated when he was hit, which was way past Brown's attack
NARRATOR: After the war, Captain Roy Brown chose not to make further statements about his attack on the Red Baron
DENNY MAY: Roy was quite convinced he had shot that red triplane down
 He never wavered from that
 If there was any reticence, it's just that he hated the war
 He was a sick man at this point
 He was looking out for his men, worried about them all, and not wanting to become a hero in anybody's eyes
 He was just doing a job
NARRATOR: When contacted in the 1930s, Roy Brown continued to refuse to answer any direct questions
CAPTAIN ROY BROWN (excerpt from letter): There is no point in my making any statement when official records are in existence
NARRATOR: Captain Brown probably fired on von Richthofen from behind and above left
 But as the medical reports showed, the Baron was hit by an upward-traveling shot to the right side
 After more than eighty years, most of the evidence fails to support Brown's claim
 So who did fire the fatal shot?
Ballistics tests can reveal the effect of a bullet fired from different ranges
 When a human body is hit there's an explosive effect called hydrostatic shock—the closer the range, the greater the wound damage
PETER FRANKS (Ballistics Consultant): If the bullet had struck von Richthofen at close range, I would have expected a more explosive-type wound
 Now the evidence is that the wounds were actually probed by the medical staff after he had been shot down, and they were actually able to follow the bullet-path through the body
NARRATOR: A low-damage, low-velocity hit would indicate a long range shot
 Moreover, one of the medical orderlies actually found the
303 bullet that had killed the Baron
"PETER FRANKS:	The fact that the bullet was found intact inside the clothing of Richthofen is another indicator that it was a long range shot"
 And I would say that would be probably 600 yards plus
NARRATOR: Australian Gunners Buie and Evans were in range and could have hit von Richthofen, as they claimed, some 20 or 30 seconds before he is known to have died
 But, by their own testimony, they were firing face on to the triplane so they could not have hit von Richthofen on the right hand side
NORMAN FRANKS: So we asked our gun expert, what do we need to look at? He said, "Have you got somebody who knows what they're doing, 600 yards away, and he's firing at Von Richthofen's right side?" We said "yes
 He said, There's your man
NARRATOR: Perched on the slope was the Australian gunnery sergeant, Cedric Popkin
 He had followed the fight and now swung his Vickers gun through 180 degrees in case the red triplane re-appeared
 He was in luck
NORMAN FRANKS: In our view and final analysis, the best candidate for bringing down von Richthofen was Cedric Popkin, Australian Sergeant machine gunner
NARRATOR: Though he was their greatest foe, the Allies buried Manfred von Richthofen alongside their own dead on April 22, 1918, with full military honors
BARON HERMANN VON RICHTHOFEN: It is very sad and ironic that he was killed at the height of his competence and success
 On the other hand, he would not have survived as a kind of symbol for chivalrous warfare as he has in being killed
NARRATOR: With the new evidence about von Richthofen's death, we may be closer to the truth, but eyewitness testimony always leaves room for doubt
 The circumstances surrounding the Baron's death will continue to be shrouded in mystery
DENNY MAY: I don't think that the world will ever know for sure who shot the Red Baron down
 That's a question that will go on in the minds of people for years and years and years
NARRATOR: In death, Manfred von Richthofen became an icon of a period that saw the dawn of aerial combat and modern warfare
 His legend grew, not merely because of his 80 victories, a score which would not be beaten until World War II, but because his dashing career recalls a brief era of innovation and heroism, although it came at unthinkable cost to human life
SUZANNE FISCHER: I think the Red Baron's real achievement was his legacy of squadron tactics
 And it wasn't just that he developed them, but he actually wrote them down so that people could use them and still do use them today
 His other achievement was his love of technology and pushing to get the best aircraft produced as quickly as possible
NARRATOR: In four short years, aerial combat had evolved from an amateurish sport to a deadly efficient killing operation
 But now the evidence of von Richthofen's death suggests a final irony
 If he indeed was killed in action by an old fashioned gun from the ground, the Red Baron may never have lost a dogfight
