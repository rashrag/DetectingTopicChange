a century ago on the Sands of Kitty Hawk two brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright bicycle mechanics and inventors built flying machines which would transform our world today is we Mark the Centennial the rights great achievement a team of modern pilots and aircraft Builders epic detectives tracking the Wright brothers 12 years of experiment station on genuine risk which would create the modern airplane
I can level it feels really good starting with simple Kites on a beach in only a Dozen Years the Wright brothers build an aircraft which manage to cross the continent
 you study the photographs and study the photographs and at some point you'll make a break through and I break through it is this is how they were thinking about this this is what they thought those are wonderful mom
 which modern computer technology and 100 year old artifacts the right secrets of Pride from history
 lost skills will need to be relearned in order to solve the mysteries of early Aviation functioning right artifact that survives it's actually I would say National Treasure
 still coming on backgrounds coming off
 more than just inventors the Wright brothers were also among the world's first test pilots if today's Builders are going to understand the rights aircraft they'll have to take a risk and fly them and came to try something that's half the world believe wasn't even possible they took great risks and they were entering an area of the unknown
 directions for the north because they were pushing the envelope all the exhibition team but one or two were killed and giving demonstration with right ear plant history shows that piloting right Flyers could be hazardous to your health modern flight simulators can limit but not illuminate the risks I dropped a lot about you being in this airplane and actually flying it so hopefully we can make that dream come true as the dreams of the early Flyers take shape questions remain unanswered and in any airplane a dream can quickly become a nightmare
 we could hear the airplane running
 and then we couldn't hear it

 on the tarmac at Washington Dulles Airport a modern airline pilot performs one of aviation's oldest rituals a walk-around inspection of his aircraft checking for loose fittings for simple Nicks and dents a pilot is ultimately responsible for every aspect of his flight
 can hide is more than a pilot he was also a historian of Aviation
 long before airplanes had radios and computers the pilot was the master of his craft an idea born in the minds of Wilbur and Orville Wright
 how the Wright brothers managed to design construct and pilot their aircraft has remained a Marvel for over a century it is kind of heights dream to build and fly the earliest airplanes to recreate the genius of the Wright brothers
 the Connecticut show in the future Generations just how much of a risk is Orville and Wilbur Wright for taking it was not easy it's still not easy today
 on the beach at Kitty Hawk another right enthusiastic Rick young experiments with the first Wright brothers aircraft when powered gliders in their lifetime really unparalleled technical achievement when I became aware that they were part of the story that were missing and we didn't know the opportunity to discover those things for ourselves that's just a resistance
 without the original diagrams Rick and Ken have to rely on the right Century old photographs of the only picture we have that shows the double movable failed you think it would have been so very incomplete Orville and Wilbur were secretive by nature and always worried about people stealing their designs
 today their secrets will have to be rediscovered
 the rights were part of a Titan it's Midwestern family eventually settling in Dayton Ohio around 1878 Orville and Wilbur's father gave the boys their first flying machine it was a children's toy a rubber band model of an aircraft before they were aircraft the brothers fluid disjointed and rebuilt it they plan to fly a full-scale version but oroville's grade school teacher wisely called a halt before any damage was done
 in 1893 after years of working at various minor businesses the Brothers open two small Bicycle Company Wilbur Wright that's approaching 30 he started taking it easy in life what's the sense that if he's ever going to make it to Mark in the world he's mrs. The time to do it and so he's he's looking for the challenge that will will do that for him and one of the great challenges at the end of the 19th century is the airplane
 working from there bicycle shop Orville and Wilbur Wright began a modest but serious research project on man flight starting with a few dollars and a Dayton public library card they transform their workshop into a laboratory of aeronautics
 Wilbur wrote a letter to the US weather bureau searching for a list of very windy locations
 you really suggested the lonely Outer Banks of North Carolina an isolated life-saving station called Kitty Hawk
 it was here that they constructed a Spartan base camp on the dunes and began the experiments which would make them famous
 the modern Workshop near Kitty Hawk Rick and Ken's team is laboring to reproduce the rights early experiments using the same wood and fabric the same wiring fittings they started with the most basic of the rights designs man carrying gliders
 I feel a lot of humility just working with the parts and pieces that we've been able to find it's absolutely amazing that they could do what they accomplished in such a short. Of time thing I have to take this off before they even began their project they broke the problem of flight into three distinct parts
 if you think about an airplane it really requires three separate systems at least two function you have to have wings that will lift you in the air you have to have a propulsion system that will move the wings through the air to generate lift I have to have a control system a means of balancing the airplane when when it's in the air the right to use their early sliders to work on the problem of Lyft how to get wood in fabric two seemingly defy gravity and Rise into the air
 that's just what the pictures look like it is
 15th and average right now and scale the rights were able to measure the amount of lift their wings were producing with the most basic problem faced by the new field of Aeronautical Engineering Aeronautical Engineering at the time of their rights simply a phrase that you can find in several books since it was dealing with machine that does moving in three-dimensional space one of those dimensions of course is up and you try to sustain the airplane in the air by creation of left any child who ever stuck at hand from a moving train what are we allies that a strong wind pushing against her Palm can produce lift
 with a rounded top surface the air passing over a wave travels farther and faster than the air underneath becoming slightly less dense
 The Wind Rises to fill this partial vacuum this concept known as Bernoulli's Theorem have been understood for 160 years but Wilbur Wright quickly discovered there was little agreement on what the proper shape of a wedding should be what he discovered was that people had made wings that would lift out of lilienthal had built gliders that carry them on over 2,000 flights through the air Samuel Langley adult wings that carried his really rather having model through the air so Wilbur Wright assume that he could rely on those folks for his initial information on wings
 in the 1890s German experimenter Otto lilienthal build a series of complex hang gliders ridiculed by cynics as a flying squirrel lilienthal base many of his designs on the curvature of birds wings and tested them by jumping off a hill he constructed near Berlin
 they assume that since lowenthal headphone rather well in his hang gliders that the data I would Chia base those gliders must be correct and that was the basis for their butt is under their first two players in 1991
 lilienthal died in the crash of one of his gliders but his published research was believed to be accurate the right to build their first wings with the same cross-section is lilienthal have used
 Pakistan gets caught right there during the season of mysterious failures the right to search for a cause their wings were not producing anywhere near the amount of lift lilienthal Staples who predicted Wilbur began to suspect that the Germans data was flawed there Lyft was one third of what they had been calculating on the basis of auto loan Falls table and they were so discouraged that they felt that the tables were definitely an error and they made a very intellectually courageous decision to not use that data and to do everything on their own
 glad we're sheltered from the wind the right seat with the wings that they had constructed work an efficient but if they had to build a complete blighter to study every slight change in WinShape there part-time project could stretch on for decades has built a great number of gliders with separate sorts of wing shapes and airfoils and that kind of thing but rather than doing that they took a much smarter approach to wind tunnel the wind tunnel itself is actually a fairly simple device rather than moving forward through the air flying the way you do with the glider in a wind tunnel position it's in one spot down here and you run air over the top of it the total it's out the device is something anyone could have done the balance is on the other hand really illustrate the Wright brothers genius constructed from a few ounces of scrap metal the right balance is one of the most important experimental devices in the history of Technology
 the simple apparatus let the rights quickly compare how much lift was produced by tiny metal Wings mounted vertically on a wire frame experiments which would take weeks with a full-scale glider could be completed hours on the right balance it's made out of Hacksaw blades bicycle spoke wire simple pieces of material that they had around the bicycle shop and yet it's every business important to the story of the Wright brothers as the glider instead they blue at Kitty Hawk
 with their balance the rights tested hundreds of airfoil shapes moving the thickest part of the wing forward from the middle up to the Leading Edge changing the width of the wing at all during the angle it would like the wind
 the Wright brothers were able to gather pieces of aerodynamic data so accurate that modern Engineers working with multimillion-dollar WindTunnel facilities are only able to improve on it by a percentage point or two
 Chucky pet sitting at Job contesting improved Wings designed in the right wind tunnel
 tiger generates just enough lift to overcome Jays weight
 that's it that's it that's a good reaction it would be nerve-racking because I'm not sure about the capabilities of this machine if they weren't holding on to it but you no not yet I'm not nervous yet exciting
 just a little bit
 map of Europe by 1902 the Wright brothers had solved the problem of lift they had designed the wing which could fly
 the adventures on the dunes stimulated the rights creativity but there was more flying than just left flying machine experimenters in the late nineteenth and early Twentieth Century faced was the issue of control and it was the Wright brothers recognition of the fact that the control issue was going to be critical that initially set them apart from virtually everyone else while most Engineers assume that a successful aircraft would need to be inherently stable as bicycle Builders the rights made their living building Vehicles which were inherently unstable they knew that a bicycle was only if the writer kept it under control
 most other experimenters in the field assume that the control issue was going to be so difficult that the best approach they could take was to build an airplane that had maximum sort of automatic stability an airplane that would fly in a straight line until the Pilot made some sort of control input to change its direction and that it would continue going in a straight straight line again early designers imagined aircraft is a kind of flying boat if wind or waves Rock the Boat it should be able to write itself instead of a boat the right start their flying machine more like a bicycle and Rider if the bike ride to the left or right it was the job of the writer to keep it up right the right student worry about building automatic stability and their airplanes and more than they design their bicycles to go without Riders
 the cyclist the Wright brothers side of themselves well if you trying to describe the act of riding a bicycle to someone who's never seen one what you're going to roll down the street in this thing with two narrow rubber tires are going to be balancing while you're operating the handlebars it would sound like the sort of feet that only the world's greatest acrobat could accomplished and yet they knew that once you learn how to ride a bike you internalize that and it becomes perfect trolling Instinct it you don't even think about it the same thing would be to machine
 simple handlebars and Body English could control a bicycle but how could a pilot control the flying machine
 the story what were told is that he was in the bicycle shop one day and a customer came in and ask for an inner tube which came in a rectangular box Wilbert was just idly toying with the box and suddenly realize that if you could put a helical twist all the way across the two wings of a biplane so that one side the tip would be put it up on the other side down and again you can put it twisted crossed it like this that would be a method of controlling the airplane in the roll axis and it's the system that ultimately came to be called Wing warping warping was controlled by swiveling the Pilot's hips
 cables transmit at the pilots movements twisting One Wing up and the other down
 from the rights first blinders to modern jets aircraft are steered by banking left and right individual to changing the shape of wings either by warping in the modern ailerons has become the basis of all controlled flight
 their idea of having an active control system coupled to a human intelligence so that the human being was every bit a part of the machine and soap an Essence said it's the man of the big airplane Becomes of the manifestation of your mind
 after several flights on a tether Jade rapping is ready to try her first free flight in the reconstructed 1902 glider
 back of the Wind
 everybody 1902 glider had wings which could both Lyft and steer the craft but controlling playing by swiveling the hips isn't easy that it can only be practiced in the air
 with a good Breeze the right slider good sale after over 600 feet
 very very very good
 so bad this is it
 with their wings producing lift and their working system allowing some control the brightness it sold two of the three problems in building an airplane
 I think that's the right to needed a way to sustain flight a small gasoline engine could provide the horsepower but it would take a propeller to actually move the plane through the air
 at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia Canon Rick have borrowed a rare original Wright brothers propeller to learn its Secrets if 15 is to build a right airplane they need to be able to carve their own propellers they want to measure the antique blades precise cross-sections without damaging them
 this apparatus used in the Auto industry is designed to measure a three dimensional object and to record its shape on a computer
 what's good
 color was one of the greats technical problems that the right space and saw that in fact when you look at the way in which they did it did really does sort of underscore the the nature of their genius people have been studying windmill blade since the 18th century and people have been using propellers on ships throughout the 19th century really so the rights assume that there was some sort of the theoretical base their that enables you to calculate propeller performance when they went to look they discovered that theoretical base simply wasn't there and they were going to have to do that themselves the great breakthrough occurred when we stopped to think about the problem and said essentially well it's much like a wing it's developing lift rather than moving forward through the air it's rotating and the lift becomes the thrust that moves the airplane forward
 a right propeller was just a wing spinning in a circle the computer reveals the propellers cross sections are the same curves as a right-wing with this connection between propellers and wings right since all of the fundamental Riddler propeller design now the brothers managed to LeapFrog all other theoretical work on aircraft propulsion in the fall of 1903 the Wright brothers are at Kill Devil Hills Rite flyer they're testing the engine they're testing the repellers cranking this thing up there literally measuring the thrust put out by the engine propeller combination they had calculated that they needed 90 lb of thrust when they measure the thrust it was a spectacular hundred thirty pounds why because their propellers were so much more efficient than even they themselves felt and Wilbur Road home that night to his family saying 6s or short because of their propellers
 but the Wright brothers kept their progress Under Wraps concerned about high-profile competition in Washington dr. Samuel Langley with $50,000 in government backing was putting the finishing touches on his massive flying machine the aerodrone Samuel Langley the third Secretary of the Smithsonian had conducted his experiments with model airplanes so when he went to build a full-scale aerodrone is he called it it was actually sort of the world's largest model airplane it was the thing that was inherently stable had some control but he was actually going to come back and worry about control later the first week of December 1903 Dr Langley's pilot Charles Manley attempted to launch his plane from a barge on the Potomac
 the huge Aerodrome was catapulted down the rail and then seconds later broke apart and plunged into the icy River
 man that was saved from drowning but is the aircraft sank so did the Public's believe the powered flight would be possible
 one week after laying these Rec working alone in the obscurity of Kitty Hawk Orville and Wilbur Wright placed a wooden tray on the dunes at attempted their own powered flight
 so when I got up that morning and had to warm themselves I've been a little breakfast Orville set the camera up and pointed it that a spot be on the end of the rail where he thought the airplane might be a bit actually left the rail and he put a coast guard swim name John Daniels in charge of the camera told him just to squeeze the ball but he saw the airplane leave the track the brother is kind of pulled off by themselves for a minute and I just talked quietly
 Orville climbs onto the airplane and when everything is ready to go he has Wilbur on the right wing tip the kind of keep it balanced and Orville flip the clip open and I only went into the air
 the first flight was 120 ft in 12 seconds each flight was a little longer than the one before it it really wasn't until the 4th flight Wilbur's fly to that they really poop far enough to prove to themselves that they to chiefed stain flight they flew down the beach and 59 seconds and it was really impressive
 there aren't many days you can actually identify when history changes but December 17th 1903 was one of those days because it was the day on which an airplane flew for the very first time
 after dinner Oroville hike down to the telegraph office and send a brief message to his father announcing the birth of Aviation and assuring him they would be home for Christmas
 back home in Dayton the following spring the Wright brothers sent out to protect their invention a small metal on the edge of town became the world's first airport 1904 and 1905 was really the only place in the entire world where you can see their plane flying cautiously a few members of the national press ventured out to the Prairie
 what are the first reporters who came to Dayton to investigate the story of the Wright brothers went around to interview the various families who would seem the rights actually operating their machine in the air over Huffman Prairie and one of them had a small boy and the reporter ask the boys if he had seen the airplane fly and what it has been like to which the kid responded by putting his arms out and running around the room going like this making airplanes and expect me when I first ran across that account but that must have been the first time in the history of the world when a child had had demonstrated the flight of an airplane in that way
 the Wright brothers did manage to turn their own childhood fascination with flight into a reality
 within a year of their first short Hops at Kitty Hawk the right to build airplanes capable of 30 minute flights
 which success their lives begin to change
 Wilbur made his first trip to Europe where he demonstrated his astounding machine before presidents and Kings the brothers were becoming the first news celebrities of the 20th century that some change from Midwestern bicycle mechanic to International luminary is revealed to can't hide in the brothers own banking records
 the Wright brothers were very cautious on how they spent money and they kept very very good records in the early 1900s the figures are very small $0.25 to repair inner tube a lot of nickel and $0.10 items as we get further in the building of the airplane we start saying much larger expenditures for tools and equipment then later on up into 1907 receiving $400 checks to patent attorneys for patent laws in Belgium France and England so it's become from just a small bicycle shop in Dayton International operation
 the right there Craft Company moved to a modern Factory after 4 years of improvements the rights began building their most advanced playing the world's first mass-produced aircraft the right model B flyer coming for the price of a fine yacht the model B was meant to be a very practical machine it's powerful engine in 40 foot wingspan become a pilot and passenger over 50 miles in the relative comfort of padded seats as a Model B lands on the White House lawn flight becomes the American dream
 this one is also measuring 64 in of the dozens of model bees built by the right company today only one remains it hangs unflyable like Philadelphia's Franklin Institute be had over a thousand parts and no original drawings of survived
 as a first step in building their own model be kind of Rick's team has come to measure the original crafts components 90 years have taken their toll on the fabric covering but the wire rigging remains intact
 all Dimensions even League top to bottom
 I can't hide their field in Virginia the next step is to exactly reproduce the model B parts
 I'm like the right small gliders their larger powered planes needed wooden frames with sparse strong enough to support two people and engine and radiator weighing 102 pounds each of the plane 70 ribs has to be individually assembled from hand saw to Spruce
 workers have to master the complex construction techniques which keep the weight of the rib to a minimum while giving you the strength of a much heavier piece
 if any part of your Craft Center section fails the entire structure could collapse
 the Wright brothers knew that this Wang had to be strong enough to hold their support and carry their lives that they needed and also had to be flexible to be able to withstand and do the wing warping that they needed to do for control arms team has obtained fabric woven from thread identical in strength and weight to the rights original
 century ago the right Factory relied on the sewing skills of local garment workers
 using a modern sewing machine an individual fabric pocket is sewn for each rib
 this transcript has attached now that the top in the only the bottom that's the only attachment of the rib to The Spar
 tennis hole fabric now can slide back and forth as a wing flexes and that's a secret I think
 the stretch fabric acts like the aluminum skin of a modern airplane providing the airfoil shape which creates the lift
 can I have a very tight airfoil and all of the components can now twisting work
 in the right Slater Plains the wing warping is controlled by strong wooden handles instead of the pilots hips without the fabric this Wing only weighs 17 pounds which is just absolutely amazing if you ask an engineer today to build your wing 13 feet long 6 foot to court he's going to be scratching his head to come in at 17 pounds
 the model B was held together by the tension of 114 steel wires anchored to the wooden frame and complex triangular designs
 the rights favorite bicycle spoke wires each connection needs to be torqued and lashed with safety lines
 the original bees 8-foot propellers for the work of skilled cabinet makers using carefully laminated Pine
 today Ken relies on the talents of a local violin maker who shapes the precise Contours of the original blades
 but then as now the most complex part of any airplane is its motor
 can hide search the world for an original 90 year old right engine which he in red cone could restore this particular engine can found in a living room in California it had been a family heirloom was originally given by Orville Wright to Al Johnson of Johnson's Flying Service in Dayton Ohio the rights canister engines from lightweight aluminum a remarkable Innovation the time when most automobile engines were made of heavy iron
 the Wright brothers engine builders or very ingenious they knew that they had to cheat me know mr. gravity every chance they got thing bicycle manufacturers they knew how to work sheet steel & tube and they would wind up with a component that weigh grams so they were doing everything they could to Safeway
 with computer-driven tools Greg is able to grind dozens of engine parts back to their original right Factory specifications
 some Pilots logbooks for 1912 suggests that the model bees engines might have a nasty tendency to throw connecting rods through the crankcase wall
 any engine is not happy if it would throw a connecting rod especially this engine because the pilot and passenger sit right beside this thing and if A-Rod should come out there's very little in between the connecting rod and got something to sign it and I did have a few failures and we are doing the best we can to make sure that we don't
 sure done a good job on his break after years of restoration Cannon Greg prepare to fire up the first Wright brothers engine to run in over 70 years prime it and go okay
 Brown's coming off Angus hot compression release
 Russian Roulette compression
 who is the compression on a pull through a few more times
 alright
 Mount Cannon Greg can hear for the first time LOL right engine really sounds
 after a series of tests it's time to mount the engine on the frame of the almost completed aircraft it has been almost a decade since the project began with hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in the construction fence pursuit of the model B has become both a business and the passion
 on a rainy spring morning Greg Kohn puts the finishing touches on the reconstructed model B
 as in the lights original version The Wooden Parts have been coated with a powdered aluminum varnish to protect them from the weather
 the Pilot's controls are carefully rig 3 actual right Factory standards
 definition of an FHA required seat belt the original plane has been Reborn
 the rights hope that their aircraft would one day be as common as a motor car but for now planes were mainly Curiosities they couldn't wait to carry Freight door to carry passengers on schedule routes or anything of that sort so the Wright brothers discovered in the end that they had almost no choice but to operate an exhibition team charge admission people would come in to watch pilots fly right airplanes and race and do stunts and make money that way although Wilbur cartridges Pilots to fly straight and level it was the Daredevil stunts which brought the crowd there was a lot of competition and everybody was trying to be flamboyant and everybody's trying to break records and everybody was trying to get their name in the paper so they were diving these airplanes at high speed and they were doing the spiral of death and they were doing high-altitude contest and as a result all the exhibition team but one or two were killed and giving demonstration with right ear plants
 in a single flying season with crack UPS in St Louis in New York and with fatal crashes at Denver and Los Angeles the right team lost some of its best Pilots
 The Flash and danger the air show circuit didn't sit easily with the rights
 for themselves and crash 2 years earlier resulting in a passengers death the rights were determined to learn from these tragedies they collected data on all the accidents involving aircraft I have a flight manual that we develop from their test a lot of newspaper articles about what happened in crashes and the biggest problem people had was getting a wink if down and not remembering which way to move the control control sure entirely different than anything that we fly today in the Curtiss Jenny or in the 7:27 if you want to turn to the left you turn the wheel to the left if you want to turn to the right here old to the right B flyer and hard to turn to the right going to pull back on a stick it's going to be a four-and-a-half movement so you can have to think about it it's not going to be an instinctive
 to learn the instincts of a right pilot can practices on a computer driven flight simulator based on performance records of a Model B
 it's authentic controls and engine sounds he hopes he can Master his reconstructed flying machine without leaving the ground
 play airplane stalls at 24 miles an hour and if you get it into stupid Bank what happens if it starts to slide sideways
 cuz it does not have the vertical fin area that a normal airplane has Wilbur and Orville both wrote that he cannot get yourself in a position where you have to think where the control is it has to be instinctively movement of your pan because if you can understand emergency situation you don't have time to think about that you just have to react normally
 the next step is to determine how the new model B performs are there has not been in her original right model be flown since 1934 and this airplane is hundred percent authentic with an original in the new Wright flyer is brought out the runway for a static engine test the same as the Wright brothers play with steak the airplane down tie a grocery scale in the back of the hanger and they would run the engine up to full power and measure how many pounds of thrust did the airplane was actually putting out
 who
 we were getting between 160 265,000 for us so we knew that are propellers performing well and we've also convinced that are in tune with operating at Peak Performance
 the plane is now ready for its first taxi tests but 4 days the weather shuts down all operations at the airstrip
 after two weeks delay the weather suddenly clears and the frustrated team seize the opportunity to test the plane
 it's not yet ready to fly but this will be one of the first times the craft moves under its own power a chance to see how its tears on the ground
 the rain has taken its toll on the grass strip and Ken decides to move the plane halfway down the runway to avoid some rough spots
 the model B has no brakes and if something goes wrong can go have much less room to stop
 behind can the propellers rev up to full power is the plane picks up speed something seems to be going wrong they are playing accelerated faster than we had experience before we got full power on the airplane that went from being very very poor as far as operation control to extremely sensitive at 4 p.m.
 Ken is having trouble keeping the plane under control with the end of the runway coming up fast he has to make a quick decision to intentionally steer the plane into a ditch or take a chance that he can get it airborne and over the trees
 the plane lifts off the end of the runway an unplanned first flight
 breadcrumb could only look on in disbelief we're still here and watched as he continued to pass the end of the runway and then he cleared the trees I had it for a gap in the trees by the end of the runway we made a slight right hand turn went out through that Gap without any problem whatsoever and I climbed out well and I was tickled pink I thought this is so it's going to be okay very gently a rolled into a left hand turn and the airplane immediately went into a left skit each time you go into a skid like that it's costing you AirSpeed and it's costing you altitude the trees are coming up pretty fast and I decided Well if we're going to go into the trees it's much better to go in on the wingtip because I'm setting strictly out here on the front end of The Spar we could hear the airplane running
 and then we couldn't hear it and then we heard it again and then we didn't hear it anymore and we knew we had to go look for him
 lawn mower engine on Queen
 what had started a few minutes earlier as a simple taxi test had gone terribly wrong but it could have been much worse airplane a lot of shock so my body didn't take a whole lot of shock I had a pretty bad bump on my head and I was bleeding and I was pretty sure my right arm was broken thumb up a tree about 30 35 feet not happy because my airplane is bad and I'm a little bit you took the emergency team almost an hour to lower can out of the tree they scrapping on a board and we went charging through the woods to get to a helicopter and I thought you know I've had a bad day with airplanes today you know this helicopter I don't know this pilot we're in the middle of the woods and there's no lights out here I thought chase you know I don't know what I want to go for another airplane ride today
 can was medivac to a regional Trauma Center
 and everybody was saying you were in of what and what kind of airplane and we were in a tree and I mean it was like we haven't had one of these before a good friend of mine said I will bet you no one in any emergency room 400 years has ever heard the story that you told them about what you've gone through with the right airplane with Ken in the hospital Greg and the team attempted to recover the remains of the model B
 Suddenlink years of effort we're hanging precariously suspended by a couple of threads airplane was held up but two of the brace wires just amazing just amazing that thing didn't come down
 so how did the plane end up in the trees what exactly did go wrong on the short flight it went first and it was like you know it's coming up we're getting for getting used to this stuff little little bit further and then decided well we're going to head back towards to feel and so I rolled it into a left hand turn again and the same thing happened it went into that black pants kid and nothing I could do with get it to come out of it the reason for the Skins is still a mystery but like every Aviation mishap the crash of the bee was the result of the series The preventable problems
 an aircraft action is always a chain of small things that accumulate this is not any different we had not planned to go flying for your plan to do a taxi test the safety equipment is sitting on the workbench in the hanger which is foolish we had to taxi down about 600 feet of the runway because of some ditching area there so that cut down on some runways face and then of course the airplane came off the ground from our calculations less than half the distance so when you add all those things up you know hindsight says if you can see it coming you know but at the time we didn't see it coming I was anxious as we are to see this thing fly
 we still haven't seen a fly Wichita Fly Away
 open associated with an airplane 10 years we have spares
 break the world's only functional right engine survive the crash with only minor damage
 but it came through relatively unscathed
 because I just kind of precious
 confessions ever going to fly again the model B will have to be completely rebuilt money will have to be raised Engineers Consulting this time Kansas team will need to be more attentive to the dangers the whole process of building authentic airplane the same as they did have a large number of people operating Hurley right airplanes ended up Dad or ended up tearing up the airplane and I think I think that's part of the equation that we really haven't thought out that well
 before Kitty Hawk Wilbur wrote that he hoped to avoid accidents long enough to learn to prevent accidents but Wilbur and Orville Wright we're both Builders and Pilots starting with their first gliders they believe that in spite of the risks actually flying their inventions wasn't Inseparable part of the process of discovering just like Wilbur said you know you can sit on the fence and watch the horse but you're not going to learn how to ride it until you finally bite the bullet and get on it and flight
 back at Ken Heights hanger the planning was used to build and fly the perfect model B
