April 20th 1918
 in the Skies over northern France Allied and German fighter aircraft a locked in a ferocious dog fight
 one of the contenders in this aerial battle is the legendary German Ace Manfred von Richthofen the Red Baron
 is distinctive red Fokker triplane is in Hot Pursuit Of The Sun Valley and its sights are two British Sopwith Camel spiders
 first one and then the second are swiftly eliminated by the deadly Marksman they are the 79th and 80th gills of the Red Baron's career
 Halo the Germans are engaged in a final mass of a pencil to end the first world war German troops and supplies pour into the Sun Valley in northeastern France
 to cover them British and Australian soldiers set up defensive artillery and machine gun positions on High Ground overlooking the River Song
 are there. It's the watch out for German reconnaissance planes both armies need to know the position of each other sources this vital intelligence can only be gathered properly from the air
 protecting German reconnaissance splice Manfred von Richthofen Germany's greatest race has brought his fear of Flying Circus up to the front opposing them a royal Air Force squadrons flying us up with camel one of the spiders ever built both sides are flying airplanes at the outset of the first World War
 back then in 1914 The Fragile Air Forces of Europe's opposing nations were little more than a sideshow
 I got that for years of Rapid Innovation the first fighter airplanes were now efficiently killing machines
 Honda Pilot celebrated Knights of the air
 the cost was horrific thousands of an on Burn bright but Guardian
 the most famous and feared of all was men Fred bun rest of them
 now in April 1918 with 80 kills to his name von Richthofen is due to go home on leave but his final day of active duty will end in death clouded by mystery
 only now has new evidence surfaced that may answer the question that has persisted for more than 80 years who killed the Red Baron up next on Nova
 in 1917 the US entered World War 1 and the first American troops landed in France eventually American Arms would turn the tide against Germany
 but in the spring of 1918 the Germans launched one final offencive to break the stalemate of the trench war
 on the morning of April 21st 94 bumper and the Red Baron takes off with the formation of Fokker dr-1 Fighters
 meanwhile of British royal Air Force Patrol of Sopwith Camel Fighters is climbing High over the front lines a dog fight begin and Allied troops in the trenches below CS up with kennel Breakaway chased by a distinctive Redbook a triplane
 the Red Baron pursued piloted by Lieutenant deep into a territory
 but as the bearing prepares to strike a second Channel piloted by Captain Roy Brown dive steeply to intercept him
 what's the machine gun fire from ground and air erupted across the Sun Valley
 but instead of Lieutenant May spending to his death it is the red trifling that has plummeted from the sky
 10 days before his 26th birthday Manfred von Richthofen is dead
 the great pilot on tactician had broken one of his own key rules for suing a risky low-level Chase into enemy territory
 Africa set volume in being a human being is not without fault and he had in very serious about the question of life and death and he must have known that one day he would be a victim himself
 at the end he was feeling very fail aesthetic on his last leave his mother was going with him to have family gathering and he mentioned that he had a toothache she told to go to the dentist and he said no it really doesn't matter anymore he needs and that he would never come back
 The Feeding Frenzy a souvenir Hunter is scavenge the red try playing as rumors flu that von Richthofen was dead
 it was a huge propaganda cool for the allies
 but who shot down the legendary Red Baron that question has divided Aviation Buffs and historians for decades
 wasting no time RAF 209 Squadron pressed home the claim of their Man Captain Roy Brown
 citing his combat report as evidence
 I got I don't feel red triclimate just firing on the 10th of May I got a long bus into him and he went down vesicle I was up to Crunch by the 10th of May
 my dad was totally convinced to his dying day that to Roy Brown was the person that shot down the Red Baron he never wavered from that nor did he have any faxed anything to tell him any different from that
 for his daring attack on Richfield and stale Captain Roy Brown was officially accredited by the board of inquiry with a famous kill
 the Canadian Airmen became celebrated as the pilot who shot down the Red Baron
 but there were dissenting voices
 several Australian Gunners claimed to have brought down the triplane when they fired on it from the mall in Coral Ridge overlooking the river some
 on the day that is that several medical officers exam
 the baron had been killed by a single 303 bullet that entered below the right arm pain and fast forward and up through his chest emerging just below the left nipple
 on his return to base Captain Roy Brown discussed his attack with Lieutenant May the Barons intended victim
 bright and my dad and talk to him though right and told him that he had project crap down at a very steep angle to intercept them that they were going along and he came in from behind and then attacked me to Quick Pass at the Red Baron Parts shots and whatever the picture how much can you get me
 The crucial question that has perplexed investigators is whether Captain Brown attacking from above and behind could have fired the Fatal shot
 and a problem when not responsible which of the many Allied soldiers on the ground was in a position to have killed the legendary Red Baron
 Manfred von Richthofen was born into minor depression nobility his father was a Cavalry officer and young man Fred inherited the Hunter's appetite and Instinct are you serious athletic he was strong as he was very much like to shooting riding Swimming All About Young Boys 2
 as far as to take him hunting as a small boy and he was very successful even as a child by his sister went said that he had the eyes of an eagle is Destiny seems clear he would join the Imperial German Army where his athleticism and horsemanship would lead him into the cavalry
 when the Great War began the traditional role of our Cavalry was reconnaissance but a new war demanded new tactics stalemate between the trenches and miles of barbed wire soon made mounted troops obsolete
 so the new technology of Aviation took on the vital role of spotting enemy trenches artillery and troop movements aircraft became the eyes and ears of battle
 I was counting college and of course I would like to thank you very much but it only the second month of the war air reconnaissance reveal the hidden direction of the German Advance on Paris The Early Air Force's at prove their worth
 Zaxby's aircraft we're still fragile underpowered and on.
 Pilots and observers took the disguise brandishing rifles and service revolvers the Ariel arms race was about to begin
 translate I need to meet aircraft in the a.m. off these pallets in service decided to take it upon themselves to Tyler Paul
 had a soldier it was that an actual thing to do to try and take your enemy here after all is the opposing side and you you're supposed to be kidding
 stranded in the Cavalry von Richthofen Envy the exploits of the new Knights of the air the young man who took to the skies to gather Vital Information for the ground forces below
 because I'm bored and he wants to have a more exciting Road in this world and he thought trained as a pilot would take much too long time he wanted to have it now and that's why he was crying happy it's going in a condescending, flights as a companion but not as a pilot
 Roderick have been transferred to the German air service and in May 1915 travel to Cologne to join an observer Flight Training Program
 I sent in an airplane for the first time the blast of wind from the propellant disturb you break everything flew away from me my flying jacket slept off my muffler was too loose in short
 it wasn't on promising debut but von Richthofen would soon get the chance to show his true talents is Hunter's Instinct and deadly Marksmanship
 machine gun that transform the ground war was there a way to somehow get it airborne
 they acting device some means of firing a gun through the rotating propeller a big problem
 the Breakthrough came with a Dashing Young French Aviator named Roland Garros already famous for winning a string of air races in the pioneer days before the war
 now he had become a test pilot for Raymond sonnier a leading aircraft designer
 Sony I was experimenting with various devices that would allow a gun to fire safely through the path of a rotating propeller
 one simple the recruit solution was to fix metal deflector wedges to the propeller Blades of his airplane propeller sometimes it's possible that sometimes it came back at you say this was gassy stuff
 in February 1915 Yaris intercepted a German reconnaissance aircraft
 within seconds he sent it burning to the ground
 the kill was followed by at least two more victories
 ghetto absolutely confounded the same confusion in the ranks
 but his success with brief soon after his engine failed Behind Enemy Lines and Garros was captured meanwhile a brilliant young Dutch design are working for the Germans Anthony Fokker came up with an improved solution to the firing problem after an aroused German interest in Focus work
 okay I thought the steel wedges where to Cruise in Risky a better idea was a mechanism that link the spinning of the propeller to the firing of the gun
 in a few weeks Walker perfected his so-called interrupter gear and engine driven system of cams and pushrods which operated the trigger of a spend-down machine gun
 the mechanism allowed the gun to fire only when the bullet would miss the propeller blades poker have delivered to the Germans the Holy Grail of the air War a synchronized forward firing machine gun you can put laundry on Castle on the airplane
 Chinese actor pointing is it was effectively looking straight down the line
 by the Autumn of 1915 the German air service had the upper hand with their synchronized front firing gun the Fokker model planes are on Deckers were arriving at the front with their ambitious young Pilots
 Amanda Knox Hamilton and Oswald Boca
 how can a woman begin to speak the language of our Warfare are not good but it was great seeing what they actually used to devise some of the early fighter tactics the young German Aces were admired and envy by Manfred von Richthofen who was still stuck as a gunner in twin-engine bombers
 he wanted to become an aerial fighter like Oswald Boca
 then a chance encounter with his Idol changed my birth life
 among us belka was the only one who shut down an enemy Airmen I asked you tell me honestly how you really do it do what you love and reply good Heavens it isn't a question I fly in as close as I can take good Aim Shoot and then falls down
 von Richthofen saw his destiny
 Becca told him if you want to have my fancy mustard fly and you must be kind of tight at and then he decided to go through the training and become a pilot
 wild laundry soap and learn to fly planes and inventing the first fighter tactics
 tried to place yourself between the Sun and the enemy attack when he least expects it never turn your back and try to run
 foolish acts of Bravery only bring death was really the father of Ariel tactics the early years of the eye wall where the area of a loan Hunters you had a particular who would hide in clouds look for 11 victim try to take them by surprise since you're the mouth
 slow two-seater spotter planes like the British be2c we're particularly vulnerable
 Beware of the Hun in the Sun
 the British ready had a problem I have several being shot down to that place and I should have deposits of calling themselves fucking father it was having an effect on my route I mean really need you to come up with some idea of how to tackle this
 to counter the threat brigadier-general huge French I responded with a new tactic he ordered that all Allied reconnaissance planes have to be supported by at least three other armed aircraft
 need to realize that they have to work together in the air that can just fly willy-nilly about us I wish this was a whole lot of information you may have been weak on your own but in numbers she was strong greater safety in numbers did the Allies a better chance but more aircraft in the skies meant an escalation of aerial combat or dog fighting
 does Monroe really was just killing time before that if you can see him before he can see you then that's 90% of the back like that
 as the Great War enter the spring of its third year both sides launch major offensives to break the stalemate between the trenches
 fast can the German Busch ever done then the Allied counter-offensive of the sun both fail epic unrelenting Slaughter would haunt the generation
 this was more unlike anything seen before
 eyes in the sky now counted more than ever to the Army's on the ground
 new accountant aircraft could transmit Morse Code by Wireless to the ground delivering real-time intelligence that could help turn a battle
 beat me, since I cried were the only ones that carried Wireless during the first world war and they were willing to pay the penalty involved because of the tremendous military advantage to be able to talk in real time to the artillery battery to the one that that's why I rather than having to stop the time I get fly back to the artillery battery land and tell him how to talk it was by which time is supposed to cook barbecue tonight
 into this Arena step Manfred von Richthofen
 now qualified as a pilot because his teeth flying supports Ortiz first in a two-seater then a 9 Decker fighter
 but as the Carnage of Verdun and the Somme Dragon below Allied Pilots begin flying new Speedy biplane fighters on with synchronized machine guns the Seesaw technological advantage now so I'm back to realize
 the Germans on the defensive needed a new plan all eyes looked at their top base Oswald Boca Boca at the idea of forming dedicated groups Justice with the best pilots in the best machines to put your golf and fun stay out of that Cracker be concentrated on particular sectors but front so that even if the Germans were outnumbered overall at the key point in the key time they might have at least you have the power to you. Sometimes she parenting
 Buckeye handpicked his wires one was a young man he did Inspire to become a fighter pilot Manfred von Richthofen
 Boca drilled his new protegerse with his tactical principles
 is Rasta to the Squadron quickly not shut up Victory after victory
 turkey was looking for aggressive capable Pilots with the Killer Instinct that really characterizes all successful fighter pilots that they needed to have a situational awareness to know what was going on around them in a dogfight they need to have good Marksmanship badge holders things I think he saw the ticket of the Marksmanship and the ruthlessness in Farmington
 toward the end of 1916 the new yastas were gaining the initiative with the arrival of the fast Albatross fighters in September German Air Supremacy was regained
 look up double his or 2:40 victories but at the height of success he was killed in a mid-air collision with one of his own men
 I'm at later Boca successor was shot down by a British Patrol
 its leader at the snowflakes Leno hooker would soon be drawn into a faithful Ariel you will
 is adversary was Manfred von Richthofen
 can just do months Manfred have not shot his first 10 kills now the rising star took off in his Albatross and Ambush talkers the H2 Squadron The Wheel of Fortune was about to turn again
 I think even say this come back as being the end of an era in a sense it's knocking the end of the arrows. Cheese's birthday should manage to Trivago. Fields and some the day he was incredibly maneuverable and poker of Izakaya talented Rachel heading towards just stayed an argument so what happened was a deadly game of tail chasing left and right I was acutely aware that I was not dealing with a beginner finally he tried to escape by flying in a zigzag course that gave me my chance
 my opponent cells shot in the head in the F-150 seat behind online another few minutes and he might have escaped
 yeah my frequency of sound to somebody it was matching him and he was the lucky one because in the end he could bring him down but to he really respected his confidence and talent
 hooker the daring British Ace was buried beside the wreckage of his airplane he was von Richthofen the 11th kill
 a shot to kill whenever possible because that was the best way of eliminating an enemy if you shoot down the plane you still have to contend with the pilot but if you got the man and got both
 on January 10th 1917 Manfred von Richthofen was appointed leader of his own Squadron fast gaining a reputation the new Commander painted his albatross
 the legend of the Red Baron was born to need it to recognize each other and it's from that that you start getting a cropping painted on his court room colors or an individual colors and shape and design craft completely read it did become the tallest man in the best was that he would not let them down he was always there always watching always trying to get them to improve he would keep his eye on all of his men at the same time he could be engaged in a very difficult single combat yeah when he came down on the ground he was able to tell each man what he had done right and what he's done wrong
 throughout the spring of 1917 the German Yost has wreaked havoc on the ground the Allies launched an attack on the stronghold of Vimy Ridge that cost both sides a total of some 30,000 cash
 McKinley in the air was equally beautiful Allied reconnaissance and fighter support for the offensive below was annihilated in a single week of what became known as bloody April the Royal flying car lost 75 aircraft
 it's teenage pilots wear off and going into combat with as little as 18 hours flying time
 they learn fast or died
 the life expectancy of a new pilot in 1917 was a matter of weeks man-for-man the proportion of those killed in action in the skies may have even exceeded the Carnage in the trenches below
 the home I'm said shut down 362 man and other units and April 7th
 Franco never had such serious losses it was the worst months of the word for them
 in bloody April Allied losses in the skies outnumber the Germans by 4 to 1
 Loretta Lynn's personal tally was Now 52 kills
 he was the leading Ace of the war
 he didn't mind having a kill which was completely defenseless did he prefer that they would tend to avoid come back by here to see if any risk but he would go in when he thought he was able to achieve his sick Hillywood going buddy buddy close and that he would Philly Underwood life
 in the wake of their severe losses the British began delivering you aircraft to the front the SE5A a fast and Powerful climber
 that's not with camel one of the most maneuverable fighters ever
 and the Bristol a versatile two-seater that could hold its own as a fire the pendulum of War began to swing back to the allies
 need a car for Uber says good if not better than the German technology in the war in the ass was more about numbers
 the Germans couldn't replace aircraft as quickly as their opponents so they tried a new tactic
 they combine yeah squadrons into larger units that could be moved around to keep pressure points on the front line
 these mobile fighter Wings the famed flying circuses food highly effective
 the first one was led by Bon rest of them are fighting service because I didn't have the number to be able to take on the British and the French everywhere along the line so what they did was set up camp around three or four I felt around town and fight until the Thunder was Iva and then move elsewhere
 despite the great success of the Flying Circus von Richthofen was no longer so sure of his own invincibility
 in a skirmish with British two-seaters the Barons suffered a severe head wound that nearly cost him his life
 they had one affected his personality pretty severely he started to have headaches frequently depression is had a concussion of course not affected his brain a little bit but he started to become a little more grouchy and for the first time he had a sense of his own mortality he knew that he was not going to survive the war
 but in the remaining months of his life the baron acquired of vital new combat Advantage Anthony Fokker the designer I've been working on a revolutionary new fighter aircraft the dr1 triplane in August 1917 he delivered it personally told him
 but the other ones triple Wing gave it the ability to climb rapidly and turn on a dime in von Richthofen skillful hands it was a lethal machine
 got tremendous advantages in maneuverability and stuff out of liked it. Because he was able to fly it to it to them it and make almost certain that nobody could ever get on his title
 as the war entered its fourth year the Ariel arms race reach the climax
